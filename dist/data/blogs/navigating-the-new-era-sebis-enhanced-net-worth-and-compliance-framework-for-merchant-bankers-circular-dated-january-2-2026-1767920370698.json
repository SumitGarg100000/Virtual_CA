The Indian financial landscape is always dynamic, isn't it? Just when you thought you had a handle on things, **SEBI** throws another curveball – or rather, a well-thought-out regulatory enhancement. This time, our focus is squarely on merchant bankers, as the market regulator operationalized significantly enhanced net worth and compliance requirements through a circular dated January 2, 2026. This isn't just another amendment; it's a foundational shift aimed at fortifying the very backbone of our capital markets. So, let's dive deep and understand what this means for us, *kyunki compliance mein koi compromise nahi chalta*.\n\nThe framework, part of amendments to the **SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992** (now referred to as the **SEBI (Merchant Bankers) (Amendment) Regulations, 2025** or **2026**), became effective from January 3, 2026, with staggered compliance timelines for existing entities.\n\n## Why the Change, *Bhai Sahab*? The Rationale Behind SEBI's Move\n\nYou might be thinking, \"Why now?\" Well, India's primary market has been on a tear, emerging as one of the world's largest equity issuance hubs, with over $21 billion raised through IPOs and public issues in 2025. This booming activity, while exciting, also brings increased risks and necessitates robust market intermediaries. SEBI's objective is clear: to ensure that merchant bankers, who play a crucial role in linking companies with investors, are well-capitalized, professionally run, and capable of withstanding market stress. The previous 1992 regulations were perhaps a bit outdated for the current scale and complexity of the market. This regulatory tightening is essentially a proactive measure to enhance investor protection, foster market integrity, and uplift professional standards.\n\n## Decoding the New Norms: What's Changed?\n\nThe circular introduces several critical changes across capital adequacy, liquidity, governance, and operational aspects. Let's break them down.\n\n### Enhanced Net Worth and Introducing Liquid Net Worth\n\nThis is arguably the most significant change. SEBI has not only hiked the **minimum net worth requirements** but also introduced a new concept of **Liquid Net Worth (LNW)**. The LNW is defined as unencumbered cash or near-cash assets, subject to prescribed haircuts, and is mandated to be maintained at all times.\n\nHere's a comparison of the old (implied) vs. new phased net worth and LNW requirements:\n\n| Requirement                               | Old Provision (Prior to Jan 2026) | New Provision (Phased Implementation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Category I Merchant Bankers**           | (Typically lower, not specified for comparison in snippets) | **Minimum Net Worth:**<br/>- Rs. 25 crore by January 2, 2027<br/>- Rs. 50 crore by January 2, 2028<br/><br/>**Liquid Net Worth (LNW):**<br/>- Rs. 6.25 crore by January 2, 2027 (25% of Net Worth)<br/>- Rs. 12.5 crore by January 2, 2028 (25% of Net Worth) |\n| **Category II Merchant Bankers**          | (Typically lower, not specified for comparison in snippets) | **Minimum Net Worth:**<br/>- Rs. 7.5 crore by January 2, 2027<br/>- Rs. 10 crore by January 2, 2028<br/><br/>**Liquid Net Worth (LNW):**<br/>- Rs. 1.875 crore by January 2, 2027<br/>- Rs. 2.5 crore by January 2, 2028                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **Compliance for New Applicants**         | Adhere to prevailing norms          | Must comply with the higher, final revised net worth (Rs. 50 crore for Cat I, Rs. 10 crore for Cat II) and LNW (Rs. 12.5 crore for Cat I, Rs. 2.5 crore for Cat II) requirements at the time of application on or after January 3, 2026.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| **Re-categorization**                     | Not explicitly detailed             | Firms failing to meet Category I requirements will be automatically designated as Category II. Those unable to meet Category II standards will be barred from fresh mandates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n### Underwriting Limits & CA Certification\n\nSEBI has capped **total underwriting obligations** at **20 times a merchant banker's liquid net worth**. Existing players have been given a two-year transition window, meaning they must comply by January 2, 2028. To ensure ongoing adherence, regular **half-yearly certification by Chartered Accountants** will be required, demonstrating compliance with capital, liquidity, and underwriting limits. This brings a significant increase in accountability for us CAs too!\n\n### Stricter Governance and Operational Standards\n\nThe regulator has also tightened the screws on governance and operational aspects:\n\n*   **Independent Compliance Officer:** Merchant bankers must appoint an **independent compliance officer**, separate from principal officers and other operational staff, by April 3, 2026. This ensures an unbiased oversight function.\n*   **Principal Officer Experience:** Principal officers, those steering the managerial and operational decisions, must now have a minimum of **five years of experience** in financial markets. Existing firms have a one-year period to comply.\n*   **NISM Certification:** Key employees and compliance officers will need to pass specified **NISM certification exams** within defined timelines. This was previously required only for key personnel, but now expands to other qualified professionals. Existing employees need to obtain certification within a year (by January 2, 2027), while those appointed after January 3, 2026, have 90 days.\n*   **No Outsourcing of Core Activities:** SEBI has prohibited the outsourcing of **core merchant banking activities**. Existing outsourcing arrangements for critical functions like IPO management, due diligence, or underwriting must be unwound by April 3, 2026. This is a big one for many firms!\n*   **Segregation of Non-SEBI Activities:** Entities engaged in non-SEBI regulated activities must segregate them through separate business units, complete with **\"Chinese walls,\"** enhanced disclosures, and board-approved controls.\n*   **Restrictions on Public Issue Participation:** Merchant bankers, their directors, key managerial personnel, or their relatives cannot lead manage any public issue if they individually or in aggregate hold more than 0.1% of the paid-up share capital or shares whose nominal value exceeds Rs. 10 lakh, whichever is lower. *Bhai, yahaan par bhi conflicts of interest ko door karna hai.*\n\n### Minimum Revenue Thresholds\n\nIn a first for the industry, SEBI has introduced **minimum revenue thresholds** from permitted merchant banking activities.\n*   **Category I entities:** Must generate at least **Rs. 25 crore** over a rolling three-year period.\n*   **Category II entities:** Must generate at least **Rs. 5 crore** over a rolling three-year period.\n\nThe first assessment for these benchmarks is slated for **FY29**. Failure to meet these thresholds could ultimately lead to the cancellation of registration, subject to exceptions for extraordinary events like pandemics. *Clearly, SEBI means business.*\n\n## Final Thoughts: What This Means for Merchant Bankers\n\nThis comprehensive overhaul by SEBI is a clear signal: the era of \"light-touch\" regulation for merchant bankers is drawing to a close. The new framework demands greater financial strength, operational rigor, and unwavering commitment to compliance.\n\nFor many existing merchant bankers, especially those in Category II, this will necessitate a serious re-evaluation of their capital structure, operational efficiency, and perhaps even their business model. The phased implementation offers some breathing room, *lekin yeh aaram ka time nahi hai, taiyaari ka time hai*. Firms need to immediately:\n*   Assess their current net worth and liquid assets against the new thresholds.\n*   Review existing outsourcing arrangements and plan for their cessation.\n*   Ensure all principal officers and key employees meet the experience and certification requirements.\n*   Strengthen internal governance, appoint independent compliance officers, and establish robust Chinese walls where necessary.\n*   Start tracking revenue from permitted activities diligently to meet future thresholds.\n\nUltimately, these changes, while challenging, are designed to create a more resilient, transparent, and trustworthy capital market ecosystem. This move will enhance investor confidence and ensure that the intermediaries facilitating India's growth story are truly world-class. It’s an opportunity for professionalization and long-term sustainability.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/circulars.html)\n\n*Published on: 9 January 2026*",
