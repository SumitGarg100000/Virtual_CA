The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has formally released the much-anticipated **Draft Income-tax Rules, 2026, and accompanying Forms** for public comments on February 7, 2026. This isn't just a routine update; this is a significant milestone, marking the operational framework for the **Income-tax Act, 2025**, which is slated to come into force from April 1, 2026. As professionals in the tax domain, yeh toh ek game-changer hone wala hai, right?\n\nThe entire exercise signals a monumental shift from the venerable six-decade-old Income-tax Act, 1961, and the Income-tax Rules, 1962. The core objective, as the CBDT has articulated, is to fundamentally simplify the provisions, drastically reduce the compliance burden, enhance ease of understanding, and ultimately, make the law far more taxpayer-friendly.\n\n## Why This Overhaul? The Vision Behind Simplification\n\nLet's be honest, the existing tax landscape, with its labyrinthine rules and numerous forms, has often been a source of anxiety and litigation. The move to the Income-tax Act, 2025, and subsequently these Draft Rules, 2026, is a concerted effort to address these long-standing issues. The department's focus is clear: to foster an environment of \"ease of living and general ease of business\" for all taxpayers.\n\nThe consultative process leading up to this draft has been broad-based, aiming to align the rules perfectly with the provisions of the new Act. This proactive approach, seeking stakeholder input even before final notification, demonstrates a commitment to a participative and effective rule-making process.\n\n## The Quantitative Impact: Fewer Rules, Smarter Forms\n\nOne of the immediate and most striking changes is the sheer reduction in volume. The existing Income-tax Rules, 1962, encompass a hefty 511 rules and 399 forms. The draft Income-tax Rules, 2026, on the other hand, propose a significantly streamlined framework with just **333 rules and 190 forms**. This reduction has been achieved by meticulously removing redundancies and consolidating provisions wherever possible.\n\nBut it's not just about numbers. The forms themselves have undergone a substantial simplification. They are designed to be \"smart\" with automated reconciliation and prefill capabilities, aiming to make filing more intuitive and less error-prone. Standardisation of common information across forms is another welcome step towards reducing compliance efforts. The language, too, has been simplified to avoid operational, administrative, or legal ambiguity. This is crucial because clarity in language directly translates to reduced interpretational disputes and, hopefully, less litigation.\n\n## Key Amendments and Rationalizations You Need to Know\n\nWhile a full deep dive into every single rule change will require more time and scrutiny, some significant amendments and rationalizations have already come to light:\n\n### 1. Revised PAN Reporting Thresholds\n\nThe draft rules propose updated thresholds for mandatory PAN quoting in various transactions, indicating a move towards greater transparency and tracking of financial activities. This is quite impactful for routine business and personal transactions.\n\n| Transaction Type | Old Provision (Implied Less Stringent/Different) | New Provision |\n| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Cash Deposits/Withdrawals | General/less defined limits for specific transactions | Mandatory PAN for annual aggregate cash deposits or withdrawals exceeding **Rs 10 lakh** in a bank account. |\n| Hotel Bills | PAN generally required for higher value transactions | **No PAN required for hotel bills below Rs 1 lakh**. |\n| Vehicle/Motorcycle Purchase | Limits likely different or less granular | PAN required for vehicle and motorcycle purchases exceeding **Rs 5 lakh**. |\n| Immovable Property Transfer | Limits likely different | PAN required for immovable property transfers exceeding **Rs 20 lakh**. |\n| Insurance Products | Not as explicitly linked to account-based relationship | PAN made compulsory for account-based relationships with insurers. |\n\n### 2. Redefined 'Accountant' for Certification Purposes\n\nThis is a critical one for our fraternity. The draft rules bring a significant change to who qualifies as an 'Accountant' for certification purposes under the new law. This change aims at ensuring higher standards and experience for such certifications.\n\n| Aspect | Old Provision (Implied Broader/Less Specific) | New Provision |\n| :----- | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Individual Professional** | Likely a general definition without strict experience/receipts criteria | Only individual professionals with at least **10 years of experience** and **annual receipts exceeding Rs 50 lakh** in the preceding year would qualify. |\n| **Partners in Firms** | Firm's overall turnover might have been considered, but no specific threshold | For partners in firms providing accountancy or valuation services, the **firm's annual receipts in the preceding year must exceed Rs 3 crore**. |\n\n### 3. Other Notable Changes\n\n*   **Perquisite Valuations:** Expect revised and potentially higher values for tax-free perquisites, aligning them with current economic realities. This could be a welcome relief for employees.\n*   **HRA Calculations:** The inclusion of several new cities for House Rent Allowance (HRA) calculations is a positive step, reflecting urban development and cost of living adjustments across various locations.\n*   **Digital Economy Integration:** The rules acknowledge the evolving digital landscape by requiring **crypto exchanges to share information** and by formally accepting **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)** as an electronic payment mode. This shows the department's intent to bring newer financial instruments under the tax net and embrace digital payments.\n*   **Capital Assets:** Detailed provisions on the method for determining the period of holding of capital assets in specific situations have been laid out.\n\nTo aid in this transition, the department has also provided two navigators – one mapping the old rules to the new draft rules and another for old forms to new draft forms. This will be incredibly helpful for us to understand the correlation and changes effectively.\n\n## Your Voice Matters: The Public Consultation Process\n\nThe CBDT has explicitly invited comments and suggestions from all stakeholders on these draft rules and forms. This is our chance, as tax professionals, to contribute to shaping the final legislation. The deadline for submitting feedback is **February 22, 2026**.\n\nThe feedback mechanism is streamlined. You can submit your suggestions through a dedicated utility launched on the official Income Tax e-filing portal. The process involves OTP-based verification. The CBDT is particularly interested in inputs across four key areas:\n\n*   Simplification of statutory language.\n*   Reduction of litigation and interpretational disputes.\n*   Lowering the compliance burden.\n*   Identification of redundant or obsolete rules and forms.\n\nWhen submitting feedback, ensure you clearly mention the relevant rule, sub-rule, or form number to which your recommendation pertains.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe release of the Draft Income-tax Rules, 2026, is a pivotal moment in India's tax reform journey. It underscores the government's commitment to creating a modern, simplified, and taxpayer-friendly direct tax regime. While the intent is certainly commendable, the devil, as they say, is often in the details.\n\nIt's imperative for all of us – chartered accountants, tax consultants, industry representatives, and individual taxpayers – to thoroughly review these draft rules and forms. Your practical insights and suggestions are invaluable in refining these provisions and ensuring that the final rules truly achieve their stated objectives. Let's make the most of this opportunity to contribute to a better, more efficient tax system for everyone.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://eportal.incometax.gov.in/iec/foservices/#/pre-login/ita-comprehensive-review)\n\n*Published on: 10 February 2026*",
