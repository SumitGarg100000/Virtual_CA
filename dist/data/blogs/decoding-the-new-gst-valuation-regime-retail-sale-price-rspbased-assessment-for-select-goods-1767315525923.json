Just when we settle into one set of rules, the government, in its continuous effort to streamline compliance and plug potential loopholes, introduces new amendments. This time, our attention is drawn to a significant development effective from **February 1, 2026**: the **CGST (Fifth Amendment) Rules, 2025**, which bring in a **Retail Sale Price (RSP)-based valuation mechanism** for a specific category of goods. This is a crucial change, dosto, and understanding its nuances is key for both manufacturers and traders in the affected sectors.\n\nYou know, the standard GST valuation framework, generally based on transaction value, aims for a fair assessment. But for certain products, especially those with a declared MRP (Maximum Retail Price) or RSP, relying solely on transaction value can sometimes lead to complexities or even revenue leakages. This is precisely where the recent amendment steps in. The Central Government, via Notification No. 20/2025–Central Tax, dated December 31, 2025, has introduced these new rules to ensure greater clarity, uniformity, and certainty in GST valuation for these goods.\n\n## The Big Change: Introducing Rule 31D\n\nThe cornerstone of this amendment is the insertion of a new **Rule 31D** into the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017. What does this mean in practical terms? It implies that, notwithstanding any other provisions within the GST valuation rules, the value of supply for certain specified goods will now be *deemed* to be their declared Retail Sale Price (RSP), minus the applicable GST amount.\n\n### Which Goods Are Under the RSP Lens?\n\nThis isn't a blanket rule, mind you. The amendment specifically targets goods where the RSP plays a significant role in consumer pricing and where valuation has historically seen complexities. The specified goods falling under the purview of Rule 31D include:\n*   Pan masala\n*   Unmanufactured tobacco (excluding tobacco leaves)\n*   Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos, and cigarettes\n*   Other manufactured tobacco and tobacco substitutes\n*   Products containing tobacco or nicotine substitutes intended for inhalation without combustion\n\nThese goods are identified by their respective tariff headings in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, specifically 2106, 2401, 2402, 2403, and 2404. Clearly, the focus is on a particular segment, primarily tobacco and related products.\n\n### Deconstructing 'Retail Sale Price' for GST\n\nThe notification is quite precise in defining **Retail Sale Price (RSP)**. It means the maximum price declared on the package, which is inclusive of all taxes, duties, cess, or surcharges, by whatever name called. What if there are multiple RSPs declared on a single package? The rule clarifies that the **highest of such prices** will be considered the RSP for valuation purposes. Furthermore, any increase in the declared RSP at any stage – be it before, during, or after the supply – will be factored in for valuation. Aur haan, if different retail sale prices are declared for different geographical areas, each such price will apply for valuation in its respective area of sale. *This flexibility is important, isn't it?*\n\n## Old Provision vs. New Provision: A Quick Glance\n\nTo truly grasp the impact, let's look at the \"before and after\" scenario for these specific goods.\n\n| Aspect                 | Old Provision (Prior to Feb 1, 2026)                               | New Provision (Effective Feb 1, 2026)                                                      |\n| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Valuation Method**   | Generally based on transaction value as per Section 15 of CGST Act. | **RSP-based valuation** as per new **Rule 31D** for specified goods. Value = RSP less applicable tax.     |\n| **Specific Goods**     | Valued like other goods, often leading to potential complexities.  | Explicitly applies to Pan masala, specified tobacco, and nicotine products (Tariff Headings 2106, 2401-2404). |\n| **Definition of RSP**  | Not explicitly defined for GST valuation purposes in this context. | Clearly defined as maximum price inclusive of all taxes, with rules for multiple/area-specific RSPs.         |\n| **Rule 86B Impact**    | General restrictions of Rule 86B applied.                          | **Relief under Rule 86B** for non-manufacturers of these goods if tax paid on RSP basis by supplier. |\n\n## The Why Behind the What: Rationale and Impact\n\nWhy this shift, you ask? The move towards RSP-based valuation for these goods appears to stem from a desire to address specific challenges. Products like pan masala and tobacco often have complex distribution chains and pricing structures. By linking GST valuation directly to the RSP, the government aims to:\n*   **Enhance Revenue Collection**: Ensure that GST is levied on a standardized, higher base, potentially increasing tax collections from these categories.\n*   **Improve Compliance**: Simplify the valuation process for these goods, making it harder for businesses to under-declare value.\n*   **Reduce Litigation**: Minimize disputes arising from complex transaction value assessments in multi-tiered distribution networks.\n*   **Level the Playing Field**: Create a more uniform and equitable tax environment across all players dealing in these specified goods.\n\nFor manufacturers, this means a recalibration of their pricing strategies and internal systems to ensure accurate RSP declaration and GST computation. For dealers and retailers, especially those who are not manufacturers, the amendment to Rule 86B offers a welcome relief by exempting them from certain restrictions if the tax has already been paid on an RSP basis by the supplier. This ensures that the downstream supply chain doesn't face undue burden once the initial valuation is settled.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis amendment is a testament to the dynamic nature of GST law in India. As tax professionals, it's our responsibility to keep abreast of such changes and guide our clients effectively. The introduction of RSP-based valuation for specific goods under the CGST (Fifth Amendment) Rules, 2025, is a significant step towards greater transparency and robust revenue administration in these product categories. Make sure your clients dealing in pan masala, tobacco, and related products are well-prepared for its implementation from February 1, 2026. *Early birds, as they say, catch the worm!*\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.cbic.gov.in/GST-Acts-Rules/notifications)\n\n*Published on: 2 January 2026*",
