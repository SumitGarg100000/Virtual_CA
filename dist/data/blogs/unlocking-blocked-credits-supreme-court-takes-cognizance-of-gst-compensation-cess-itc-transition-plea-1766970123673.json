Trying to untangle complex Input Tax Credit (ITC) knots. Sometimes, these knots feel less like a minor inconvenience and more like a significant drain on working capital. A prime example that's been giving many businesses sleepless nights is the fate of accumulated **GST Compensation Cess ITC** post its abolition. Well, *acche din aane wale hain*? The Supreme Court has now stepped in, issuing a notice on a crucial plea seeking to allow the transition of these stranded credits. This is a significant development, and it warrants a detailed analysis.\n\n## The Compensation Cess Saga: A Quick Recap\n\nLet's rewind a bit. The **Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017**, introduced the Compensation Cess. Its primary objective was to compensate states for any revenue loss arising from the implementation of GST. This cess was levied on certain \"luxury and sin\" goods, including items like automobiles and coal. Businesses that paid this cess on their inputs were eligible to claim **Input Tax Credit (ITC)**. However, there was a critical caveat: this cess ITC could only be utilized against an output **Compensation Cess** liability; cross-utilization against CGST, SGST, or IGST was not permitted.\n\nFast forward to September 22, 2025. Following recommendations from the 56th GST Council meeting, the **Compensation Cess was largely abolished** for most goods, including passenger vehicles and coal, via **Notification No. 2/2025-Compensation Cess Rate dated September 17, 2025**. The rates of cess were effectively subsumed into enhanced GST rates on these goods. While this was a move towards simplifying the tax structure, it inadvertently created a new, substantial problem for many businesses.\n\n## The Current Conundrum: Blocked ITC on Stock\n\nHere's where the real trouble began. When the Compensation Cess was abolished, many businesses were left with significant balances of **unutilized Compensation Cess ITC** in their electronic credit ledgers, especially on stock held as of the date of abolition. *Ab saval yeh uthta hai* – how do you utilize this credit when there's no corresponding output cess liability anymore? It's like having a special currency that suddenly became invalid, with no mechanism to exchange it. This scenario led to:\n\n*   **Blocked Working Capital:** Businesses found substantial amounts of capital stuck as unutilized credit.\n*   **Potential Double Taxation:** The cess was paid on inputs, but with its abolition, and the corresponding increase in GST rates on the output, effectively, the embedded tax burden continued without the benefit of credit utilization.\n*   **Liquidity Challenges:** The inability to set off these credits severely impacted the financial health and liquidity of many enterprises.\n\n## The Supreme Court Intervention: Sendoz Commercials & Others\n\nRecognizing the severity of this issue, the Supreme Court has now intervened. On **December 28, 2025**, the Apex Court issued a **notice to the Union of India** on a writ petition filed by **Sendoz Commercials Private Limited** [Writ Petition (Civil) No. 1219 of 2025]. The petitioner's prayer is straightforward: to allow the transition and adjustment of accumulated GST Compensation Cess ITC, in respect of stock held as on the date of abolition of the Cess, towards the Goods and Services Tax payable thereon.\n\nWhile Sendoz Commercials is a key petitioner, other industry bodies, such as the **Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA)**, have also moved the Supreme Court with similar pleas, highlighting an estimated industry-wide loss of approximately ₹2,500 crore worth of cess credits lapsing under the new framework.\n\nWhat does \"issuing a notice\" signify? It means the Supreme Court has acknowledged the *prima facie* merit and constitutional questions raised by the petition. It’s the first formal step, inviting the government to present its side of the argument. It indicates that the court believes these are issues that warrant detailed judicial examination.\n\n## Pivotal Legal Arguments\n\nThe petitioners are building their case on several robust legal and constitutional grounds:\n\n*   **Vested Right to ITC:** A core argument is that **Input Tax Credit**, once validly accrued, constitutes a **vested right** in the nature of advance tax already paid. This right, they contend, cannot be arbitrarily, unreasonably, or retrospectively taken away by the State.\n*   **\"Property\" under Article 300A:** Drawing parallels to previous judgments, the petitioners argue that accrued ITC is essentially \"property\" within the meaning of **Article 300A of the Constitution of India**. Consequently, it cannot be extinguished without satisfying the twin requirements of public purpose and compensation. *Yeh toh seedhi baat hai, paisa blocking toh nahi chalega!*\n*   **Constitutional Validity (Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 246A):**\n    *   The plea highlights that the GST Compensation Cess is an **incremental levy to GST**, and both derive their legislative competence from **Article 246A of the Constitution of India**. Therefore, upon abolition of the cess, the accumulated credit should logically be permitted to transition against GST liability.\n    *   The denial of transition is also being challenged as **arbitrary and discriminatory** under **Article 14**, and an unreasonable restriction on the taxpayer's **freedom to carry on trade or business** guaranteed under **Article 19(1)(g)** of the Constitution. This blockage directly impairs the ability of businesses to operate viably, causing significant impact on working capital.\n\n## Drawing Parallels: The Export Refund Precedent\n\nIt's worth recalling a related, albeit distinct, landmark judgment by the Supreme Court just recently, on **October 28, 2025**. In that ruling, the Apex Court upheld the Gujarat High Court's decision allowing the **refund of unutilized GST Compensation Cess ITC accumulated on inputs used to manufacture exported goods**, even if those exports were made with payment of IGST. The Court categorically stated that statutory rights to refund cannot be curtailed by executive circulars.\n\nWhile that case specifically dealt with exports and the refund mechanism, its underlying principle – that accrued ITC is a statutory entitlement and a vested right – provides a strong precedent and a ray of hope for the current plea regarding the transition of cess ITC on domestic stock. *Taxes ka bojh export par nahi, toh domestic supply par bhi nahi hona chahiye, hai na?*\n\n## What Lies Ahead? Implications for Businesses\n\nThe Supreme Court's issuance of notice marks the beginning of what could be a pivotal legal battle for numerous businesses. If the Court rules in favor of the petitioners, it could mean:\n\n*   **Significant Relief:** Unlocking substantial blocked credits, thereby improving cash flow and financial health for affected sectors.\n*   **Clarity on ITC as \"Property\":** Further cementing the legal standing of Input Tax Credit as a vested right under constitutional provisions.\n*   **Retrospective Adjustments:** Potential for businesses to claim adjustments for past periods where credits were denied.\n\nHowever, the process will involve detailed arguments from both sides, and the Union of India will now prepare its counter-affidavit. The outcome will depend on how the Supreme Court interprets the legislative intent behind the abolition of the cess vis-à-vis the constitutional rights of taxpayers.\n\n## Conclusion: A Ray of Hope for Stranded Credits\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to issue notice on the plea for the transition of accumulated GST Compensation Cess ITC is a welcome development for the business community. It acknowledges a long-standing grievance and opens the door for a definitive resolution to the issue of stranded credits. For now, all eyes will be on the Apex Court as this critical matter unfolds. This judgment, *agar taxpayer ke favour mein aaya*, will not just offer financial relief but also reinforce fundamental principles of tax justice and vested rights under the Indian Constitution. Stay tuned, because the legal landscape around GST ITC is constantly evolving!\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Visit the Supreme Court of India website for case status and judgments](https://main.sci.gov.in)\n\n*Published on: 29 December 2025*",
