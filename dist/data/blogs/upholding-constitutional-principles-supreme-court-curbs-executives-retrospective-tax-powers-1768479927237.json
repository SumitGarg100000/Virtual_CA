Hope you're all keeping well and navigating the ever-evolving tax landscape. We often discuss the challenges arising from retrospective tax amendments, a topic that has, at times, caused significant heartburn for businesses and professionals alike. Well, the Supreme Court has once again stepped in, delivering a crucial judgment on January 5, 2026, that firmly restricts the executive's power to levy and collect taxes retrospectively. This ruling is a significant shot in the arm for certainty and predictability in our tax regime, reinforcing the foundational tenets of our Constitution.\n\nLet's dive deeper into this landmark decision, *Adani Power Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.*, and understand its far-reaching implications.\n\n## The Genesis of the Dispute: A Case of Enduring Retrospective Application\n\nThe core of this protracted legal battle revolved around the levy of customs duty on electricity generated within a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and supplied to a Domestic Tariff Area (DTA). The government's actions stemmed from the **Finance Act, 2010**, which retrospectively introduced a 16% customs duty on such electricity clearances, effective from June 26, 2009. This was then operationalised through **Notification No. 25/2010**.\n\nNow, if you recall, the **Gujarat High Court** had previously examined this very issue. In 2015, it categorically struck down this levy of customs duty, declaring it to be \"without authority of law\" and in violation of **Article 265 of the Constitution**. Article 265, as we know, is a bedrock principle, stating unequivocally that \"No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.\"\n\nDespite this clear declaration from the High Court, which attained finality when the Supreme Court declined to interfere, the Union continued its efforts to recover duties for subsequent periods, issuing fresh notifications (like 91/2010 and 26/2012) that essentially sought to continue the very levy that had been declared illegal. This persistent reassertion of the same impost, albeit in altered forms, led to the present appeal before the Apex Court.\n\n## The Legal Compass: Navigating Constitutional Boundaries\n\nThe Supreme Court, in this judgment, meticulously revisited several critical legal and constitutional principles:\n\n*   **Article 265 - The Constitutional Mandate:** The Court re-emphasized that the power to tax is a sovereign power, but it is not unbridled. It must always derive its authority from explicit law enacted by the legislature. Any levy or collection without such statutory backing is unconstitutional.\n*   **Limits of Delegated Legislation:** A recurring theme in Indian jurisprudence is the extent to which the executive, through subordinate legislation (like notifications and circulars), can impose or alter tax liabilities. The Court reiterated that delegated legislation cannot create a new tax or expand the scope of a charging provision where the parent act does not clearly intend it.\n*   **The *Ultra Vires* Principle:** When the very act of levying tax is beyond the powers conferred by the statute or the Constitution, it is *ultra vires*. The Court highlighted that once a levy is found to be *ultra vires*, its subsequent application, especially retrospectively, inherently fails.\n*   **Judicial Discipline and Finality of Judgments:** A crucial aspect of the ruling was the Court's emphasis on the binding nature of judicial pronouncements. It stressed that judicial decisions, once final, are not mere advisory opinions but \"binding commands of law.\" The executive is constitutionally obligated to implement these decisions faithfully, rather than resisting them through modified instruments or by confining them to specific periods or notifications.\n\n## The Apex Court's Verdict: A Clear Message Against Executive Overreach\n\nIn a resounding pronouncement, the Supreme Court unequivocally **set aside the Gujarat High Court's judgment of 2019** (which had earlier dismissed Adani Power's refund claim, holding the earlier High Court ruling to be notification-specific). The Apex Court declared that the levy of customs duty on SEZ-to-DTA electricity for the period 2010-2016 was, indeed, \"without authority of law.\"\n\nHere are the key takeaways from the Court's powerful decision:\n\n*   **No Retention of Illegally Collected Amounts:** The Court firmly held that the executive **cannot retain any amount collected under a levy that was imposed without the explicit authority of law.** This is a significant principle, ensuring that the state cannot unjustly enrich itself from unconstitutional demands.\n*   **Retrospective Liability Needs Explicit Legislative Sanction:** A core aspect reinforced is that the executive **cannot retrospectively impose tax liability without a clear and explicit legislative mandate**. Subordinate legislation, like notifications, cannot be used to create such retrospective charges, especially when the fundamental levy itself is flawed.\n*   **Colourable Exercise of Power:** The Court sharply criticized the government's attempts to impose duty through \"exemption notifications,\" terming it a \"colourable exercise of delegated authority.\" The bench observed that \"What could not be done directly has been sought to be achieved indirectly, which is impermissible in law.\"\n*   **Mandatory Restitution:** Once a levy has been held to be without the authority of law, the state has a constitutional duty to refund the collected amounts. The Court stated, \"Restitution is a necessary incident of the finding of illegality.\"\n*   **Binding Nature of Precedent:** The Supreme Court cautioned against judicial benches attempting to dilute or narrow down earlier binding declarations of law. It underscored that the basic declaration that a levy lacked a charging provision goes to the root of jurisdiction, and mere changes in rates or formats cannot cure such a foundational illegality.\n\n## Implications & Key Takeaways for Tax Professionals\n\nThis judgment is a monumental step in safeguarding the rule of law and ensuring that the executive operates within its constitutional bounds when it comes to taxation. For us, as tax professionals and businesses, here's what this means:\n\n*   **Enhanced Taxpayer Protection:** This ruling provides robust protection against arbitrary retrospective tax demands initiated by executive notifications that lack clear legislative backing. Businesses can have greater confidence that settled legal positions will not be easily overturned by administrative fiat.\n*   **Clearer Lines on Delegated Legislation:** It sets a strong precedent regarding the limitations of delegated legislation in tax matters. Any attempt by the executive to introduce new taxes or apply existing ones retrospectively through notifications, without explicit legislative sanction, will face heightened judicial scrutiny.\n*   **Importance of Article 265:** The judgment underscores the paramount importance of Article 265. Tax departments must ensure that every levy and collection is backed by proper statutory authority, not just administrative convenience.\n*   **Expect Greater Caution from the Executive:** Moving forward, the government and its departments will likely exercise greater caution when contemplating retrospective changes or imposing new levies through subordinate legislation, especially if a previous legal challenge has found the underlying action to be *ultra vires*.\n\nThis decision is not just about a specific customs duty; it's a reaffirmation of the fundamental principle that in a constitutional democracy, governance, particularly taxation, must be strictly \"by authority of law.\" It's a healthy reminder that even while striving for revenue collection, the state cannot bypass the legislative process or disregard established judicial pronouncements. *Yeh toh acchi baat hai for stability!*\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://main.sci.gov.in/judgments)\n\n*Published on: 15 January 2026*",
