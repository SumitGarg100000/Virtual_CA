For foreign enterprises providing services to Indian clients, the concept of a **Permanent Establishment (PE)** is often the sword of Damocles, dictating whether their hard-earned profits become taxable in India. Recently, the Delhi High Court has once again stepped in, providing much-needed clarity on the vexing concept of a **\"Virtual Service PE.\"** This judgment, delivered on December 23, 2025, is a significant moment, reminding us that treaty language holds paramount importance in international taxation.\n\n### The Digital Conundrum: Can You Have a PE Without a Physical Footprint?\n\nImagine a foreign legal advisory firm, based out of Singapore, routinely providing expert advice to Indian corporations. Their team might visit India for short stints, perhaps for client meetings or specific project deliverables. But what about the bulk of their work, performed remotely from their home country? Can the mere fact that Indian clients benefit from these services create a taxable presence – a PE – in India, even without a sustained physical presence of personnel? This exact question landed before the Delhi High Court, and believe you me, its implications are far-reaching.\n\n### The Case at Hand: Commissioner of Income Tax (International Taxation) v. Clifford Chance Pte Ltd\n\nThe Delhi High Court, in the case of **Commissioner of Income Tax (International Taxation) v. Clifford Chance Pte Ltd (ITA Nos. 353–354/2025)**, addressed this intricate issue, specifically under the **India-Singapore Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)**. The case involved a Singapore-based international law firm, Clifford Chance Pte Ltd, providing legal advisory services to Indian clients for the Assessment Years (AYs) 2020-21 and 2021-22.\n\n#### The Factual Matrix: Days Counted, Days Disputed\n\nFor AY 2020-21, two employees of Clifford Chance were physically present in India for a cumulative period of 120 days. However, the firm contended that after meticulously excluding days spent on vacation, business development activities (which are non-billable), and overlapping common days, the actual days dedicated to rendering client services in India amounted to only 44 days. This figure, importantly, fell below the 90-day threshold stipulated under **Article 5(6)(a)** of the India-Singapore DTAA for the constitution of a Service PE.\n\nFast forward to AY 2021-22 – a year when the world was deeply entrenched in remote working. During this period, no employees of Clifford Chance physically visited India; all services were rendered entirely from outside India.\n\n#### Revenue's Stance: Expanding the Ambit of PE\n\nThe Income Tax Department (Revenue) presented a robust argument, pushing for a broader interpretation of PE. For AY 2020-21, they argued that all days of physical presence, irrespective of the nature of activity, should be counted towards the 90-day threshold. More significantly, for AY 2021-22 (and even for AY 2020-21), the Revenue introduced the concept of a \"Virtual Service PE.\" Their contention was that with rapid digitalization, a physical presence isn't strictly necessary anymore to establish a taxable nexus. They cited OECD reports on the digital economy, foreign jurisprudence, and even India's domestic law amendments like **Significant Economic Presence (SEP)**, to buttress their argument that the policy intent was to tax such digitally enabled services. Basically, unka kehna tha ki jab services India mein provide ho rahi hain, toh PE bhi banega.\n\n#### Assessee's Counter: Strict Adherence to Treaty Language\n\nClifford Chance, on the other hand, strongly advocated for a strict interpretation of the DTAA. Their core argument revolved around the precise wording of Article 5(6) of the India-Singapore DTAA, which explicitly states that a Service PE arises if services are \"furnished **within India** through its employees or other personnel.\" The firm asserted that this phrase inherently mandates a **physical nexus** – actual performance of services by employees physically present in India.\n\nFurthermore, they argued that vacation days, business development days, and common days, during which no chargeable client services were rendered, must be excluded from the 90-day count. Most critically, the firm highlighted that the India-Singapore DTAA does not *expressly* include or recognize the concept of a \"Virtual Service PE.\" They emphasized that tax treaties are outcomes of bilateral negotiations between sovereign states and must be interpreted strictly based on their text, without reading in concepts not explicitly stated. Also, they correctly pointed out that under **Section 90(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961**, treaty provisions prevail over domestic law if they are more beneficial to the taxpayer.\n\n### The Delhi High Court's Decisive Ruling: Physical Nexus is Key\n\nThe Division Bench of Justice V Kameswar Rao and Justice Vinod Kumar of the Delhi High Court dismissed the Revenue's appeals, thereby upholding the decision of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in favor of Clifford Chance.\n\nThe Court’s judgment firmly established the following:\n\n*   **No Virtual Service PE under India-Singapore DTAA:** The Delhi High Court categorically held that the concept of a \"Virtual Service PE\" is **not recognized** under the India-Singapore DTAA. The treaty, as currently drafted, requires a tangible territorial nexus for a Service PE to arise.\n*   **Physical Presence is Paramount:** The Court reiterated that Article 5(6) explicitly requires services to be furnished \"within India\" and \"through employees or other personnel.\" This phrasing, according to the Court, mandates a **physical footprint** in India. Remote or virtual services provided from outside India, even if benefiting Indian clients, do not, by themselves, create a Service PE under the existing DTAA.\n*   **Strict Treaty Interpretation:** The judgment underscored that tax treaties are a result of careful bilateral negotiations. Courts cannot, by judicial interpretation, read in concepts or expand the scope of treaty provisions that are not explicitly present in the text, simply because of technological advancements or evolving digital business models. To extend treaty provisions to cover virtual presence, the DTAA itself would need to be renegotiated or supplemented.\n*   **Days Calculation for AY 2020-21:** For AY 2020-21, the Court agreed that only days where actual services were rendered to clients in India should be counted. Since the relevant days amounted to 44, falling below the 90-day threshold, no Service PE was constituted.\n*   **AY 2021-22: No PE Whatsoever:** In the absence of any employee visits to India during AY 2021-22, the Court affirmed that no PE of any kind existed.\n*   **Taxability:** Consequently, the legal fees earned by Clifford Chance Pte Ltd from Indian clients for the relevant assessment years were held to be not taxable in India due to the absence of a PE.\n\n### Final Thoughts: A Breath of Fresh Air for Foreign Service Providers\n\nThis Delhi High Court judgment is a critical piece of guidance for international law firms and other professional service providers engaged in cross-border activities with India. It reinforces the fundamental principle that, under existing DTAAs like the India-Singapore treaty, **physical performance of services remains central to the Service PE analysis**. Remote or virtual services, by themselves, do not create a tax nexus in the absence of express treaty provisions.\n\nYeh ruling ek bahut badi rahat hai un foreign entities ke liye jo India mein services provide kar rahe hain. It provides a degree of certainty and predictability in an area often clouded by ambiguity. While the digital economy continues to evolve, pushing the boundaries of traditional tax concepts, this judgment firmly reminds tax authorities and taxpayers alike that the agreed-upon treaty language is the ultimate arbiter, at least until those treaties are expressly amended. It also highlights the importance of meticulously tracking the physical presence of employees and the nature of their activities in India to ensure compliance and avoid unintended tax exposures.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://delhihighcourt.nic.in/judgments.asp)\n\n*Published on: 24 December 2025*",
