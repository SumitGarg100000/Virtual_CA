It often feels like the department *har baar* resorts to the extended period, almost mechanistically, without genuinely establishing the foundational elements. This practice, frankly, creates undue burden and anxiety for taxpayers.\n\nBut fret not, fellow professionals! The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, in a recent landmark judgment dated **November 11, 2025**, in the case of **_Neeyamo Enterprise Solutions Private Limited vs. Commercial Tax Officer (Intelligence)_**, has come to our rescue. The Hon'ble Mr. Justice G.R. Swaminathan has unequivocally clarified the crucial \"jurisdictional facts\" that *must* be present for the extended period under Section 74 to be validly invoked. This isn't just another ruling; it's a critical reminder of due process in GST administration.\n\n## Unpacking Section 74: Beyond Mere Non-Payment\n\nBefore we dive into the Court's analysis, let's quickly recap **Section 74** and why it's distinct. This section deals with the determination of tax not paid or short paid, or input tax credit wrongly availed or utilized, or erroneous refund obtained, **\"by reason of fraud, or any willful misstatement or suppression of facts to evade tax.\"** The key differentiator here is the element of *mens rea* or fraudulent intent. When these elements are present, the department gets an extended period of limitation – five years from the due date for furnishing the annual return for the relevant financial year. In contrast, **Section 73** deals with cases where such discrepancies arise due to reasons *other than* fraud, willful misstatement, or suppression, and carries a shorter limitation period of three years.\n\nThe challenge, as many of us know, has been the frequent invocation of Section 74 even in cases that clearly fall under Section 73. *Arre bhai, har cheez mein fraud thodi na hota hai!*\n\n## The Madras High Court's Incisive Analysis in *Neeyamo Enterprise Solutions*\n\nThe genesis of the *Neeyamo Enterprise Solutions* case was quite common. The petitioner faced multiple assessment orders under Section 74 of the TNGST Act, 2017 (analogous to CGST Act, Section 74), for various financial years. These orders stemmed from show cause notices issued after a surprise inspection under Section 67, alleging short payment of tax and wrongful availing of input tax credit. However, the crucial aspect was that **neither the show cause notices nor the consequent orders contained any specific allegation of fraud, willful misstatement, or suppression of facts**.\n\nThe petitioner challenged these orders, arguing that the department had wrongly invoked Section 74 in the absence of the mandatory preconditions.\n\n### The Court's Clear Pronouncements:\n\nThe Hon'ble Justice G.R. Swaminathan laid down several key principles:\n\n*   **Jurisdictional Facts are Paramount:** The Court emphatically stated that **fraud, willful misstatement, or suppression of facts to evade tax are \"jurisdictional facts\"**. Without the explicit allegation and substantiation of these elements, the proper officer has no legal authority to proceed under Section 74. Their absence strikes at the very root of the proceedings.\n*   **Specific Allegations are a Must:** The SCN itself *must clearly spell out* whether the assessee is being charged with fraud, suppression, or willful misstatement. It must also disclose the material on which such a tentative conclusion has been formed. Mechanical invocation, without placing on record specific evidence demonstrating these ingredients, is impermissible.\n*   **No Pre-determination:** The Court also took exception to the use of the word **\"determined\"** in the SCNs instead of **\"specified\"**, noting that it indicated a pre-judgment by the authority even before hearing the taxpayer. This reflects a violation of natural justice.\n*   **No Remand if Jurisdiction is Absent:** A significant aspect of the ruling is that if the foundational jurisdictional facts are missing, the entire proceedings under Section 74 are void and illegal. In such a scenario, the Court clarified that it would **quash the orders outright, without remanding the matter** for reconsideration. *Baat khatam, paisa hazam nahi hoga!* While procedural lapses might warrant a remand, a fundamental absence of jurisdiction means the proceedings cannot be salvaged.\n*   **Liberty to Proceed under Section 73:** The Court, while quashing the Section 74 orders, clarified that the department is **not precluded from initiating proceedings under Section 73** (normal limitation period) if legally permissible. This provides an avenue for the department to recover tax where the intent to evade is not established, but regular tax liability exists.\n\nThis judgment reinforces the legal position that Section 74 is an exceptional power, meant for cases of deliberate wrongdoing, and not a routine tool for demand recovery. Mere non-payment or short payment of tax, by itself, does not constitute fraud or suppression; the department must establish that such non-payment was *by reason of* the fraudulent conduct.\n\n## Implications for Taxpayers and the Department\n\nThis ruling is a significant shot in the arm for taxpayers. It provides a robust legal basis to challenge SCNs and orders where the department has failed to establish the critical jurisdictional facts required for Section 74.\n\n*   **For Taxpayers:**\n    *   **Scrutinize SCNs:** Carefully examine every SCN under Section 74. Does it explicitly allege fraud, willful misstatement, or suppression of facts? Does it provide material evidence to support these allegations? If not, it's a strong ground for challenge.\n    *   **Respond Diligently:** Even if the jurisdictional facts are missing, always file a detailed reply to the SCN, highlighting the absence of these crucial elements.\n    *   **Consider Writ Petitions:** Where jurisdictional facts are absent, a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the jurisdictional High Court can be an effective remedy.\n*   **For the Department:**\n    *   **Due Diligence is Key:** This judgment mandates that tax authorities conduct proper investigations to gather evidence of fraud, willful misstatement, or suppression *before* invoking Section 74.\n    *   **Specific Allegations:** SCNs must be drafted with precision, clearly articulating the specific allegations and the material supporting them. Generic language will no longer pass muster.\n    *   **Distinguish Sections 73 and 74:** The judgment underscores the clear distinction between the two sections. Authorities cannot use Section 74 merely to overcome the normal limitation period under Section 73.\n\n## Final Thoughts: A Clearer Horizon\n\nThe Madras High Court's decision in *Neeyamo Enterprise Solutions* brings much-needed clarity and reinforces the principles of natural justice and strict interpretation of extended limitation provisions. It's a welcome move that nudges the department towards a more responsible and legally compliant approach when dealing with demand and recovery under GST. *Ab toh authorities ko bhi thoda homework karna padega!* This judgment will undoubtedly set a precedent for similar cases across the country, ensuring that the exceptional powers under Section 74 are invoked only when truly warranted.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis)\n\n*Published on: 30 December 2025*",
