For financial institutions claiming deductions under **Section 36(1)(viii)** of the Income Tax Act, 1961, this term has been a constant source of debate, leading to significant uncertainty. Well, the much-anticipated Supreme Court judgment, delivered on December 10, 2025, has finally brought much-needed clarity, or perhaps, a stricter interpretation, to this critical phrase. This decision is set to redefine how financial entities approach their claims under this beneficial provision.\n\n### The Genesis of the Debate: Understanding Section 36(1)(viii)\n\nLet’s first recap what **Section 36(1)(viii)** is all about. This provision allows a deduction to certain financial institutions for amounts transferred to a special reserve account. The primary aim is to incentivize these entities to build robust capital bases, enabling them to provide long-term finance for crucial sectors like industrial and agricultural development, housing, and infrastructure facilities in India. The deduction is capped at **20% of the profits derived from eligible business**, computed under the head \"Profits and gains of business or profession\".\n\nThe bone of contention has always been the precise scope of \"profits derived from eligible business.\" Does it encompass all income generated by such an entity, or only those directly flowing from its core long-term financing activities? Many financial corporations, quite understandably, have sought to interpret this broadly, often including incidental incomes as part of the \"eligible business\" profits. However, the Supreme Court has now decisively slammed the door on such expansive interpretations.\n\n### The Nuance of \"Derived From\": A Look at Legal Precedents\n\nThe phrase \"derived from\" has a rich history in Indian tax jurisprudence. Courts have consistently held that \"derived from\" implies a direct and immediate nexus between the income and the source activity, in contrast to the broader term \"attributable to,\" which suggests a more remote connection. For instance, in various sections granting deductions for profits from industrial undertakings, income from interest on fixed deposits, or sale of import entitlements, has often been held *not* to be \"derived from\" the core industrial activity, even if it's treated as business income. The rationale is simple: the source of such income (e.g., bank deposits or import licenses) is distinct from the primary business operations.\n\nThis established principle was the foundation upon which the Supreme Court built its recent clarification for Section 36(1)(viii).\n\n### The Apex Court's Verdict: A Strict Interpretation Reigns Supreme\n\nThe recent Supreme Court judgment on December 10, 2025, specifically dealt with an appeal concerning a statutory financial corporation, the National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC), which had claimed deductions under Section 36(1)(viii) on various income streams. The core question before the Court was whether income like dividend income on investments, interest earned on short-term bank deposits, and service charges for monitoring certain loans could be considered \"profits derived from the business of providing long-term finance\".\n\n#### Facts in Focus (A Fictionalized Scenario based on the reported judgment):\n\nThe assessee, a specified financial entity, primarily engaged in providing long-term loans. However, it also earned:\n*   **Dividend income** from strategic investments in shares of other companies.\n*   **Interest income** from temporarily parking its surplus funds in short-term fixed deposits with banks.\n*   **Service charges** for acting as a nodal agency to monitor loans disbursed from government funds, which were distinct from its own long-term lending operations.\n\nThe assessee contended that since these incomes were reflected in its profit and loss account as business income, they should qualify for the deduction under Section 36(1)(viii).\n\n#### Legal Provisions Examined:\n\nThe Court meticulously examined:\n*   **Section 36(1)(viii)** of the Income Tax Act, 1961, with a particular focus on the phrase \"profits derived from eligible business\".\n*   The **Explanation to Section 36(1)(viii)**, which defines \"long-term finance\" as loans or advances repayable over a period of five years or more.\n*   Relevant judicial precedents that have interpreted the term \"derived from\" in other tax deduction provisions.\n\n#### The Court's Decision and Rationale:\n\nThe Supreme Court, while rejecting the appellant's arguments, unequivocally held that the income tax deduction under Section 36(1)(viii) is **limited strictly to profits directly and effectively derived from the business of providing long-term finance**. It clarified that merely being classified as \"business income\" is insufficient to automatically qualify for this special deduction, which operates on a much narrower statutory plane.\n\nThe Court's key observations included:\n*   **Direct Nexus is Paramount:** The phrase \"derived from\" mandates a direct and immediate connection. Income from incidental or ancillary activities, even if part of the overall business, does not meet this stringent test.\n*   **Distinct Sources:** Dividend income arises from investment in shares, and interest on short-term deposits stems from the temporary deployment of surplus funds. These receipts originate from independent and distinct sources, not from the corporation's own long-term lending operations.\n*   **Legislative Intent:** The Court emphasized that Parliament's 1995 amendment, which changed the deduction base from \"total income\" to \"profits derived from eligible business,\" was a deliberate legislative move to restrict the scope of this incentive. To allow a broader interpretation would effectively revert to the pre-amendment position, rendering the legislative change otiose (meaningless).\n*   **Purpose of the Provision:** The incentive under Section 36(1)(viii) is designed to strengthen financial institutions for long-term lending. Extending it to passive treasury operations or other non-core income would defeat this statutory purpose.\n\nIn essence, the Court distinguished between profits that have a **first-degree nexus** with the eligible business and those with a secondary or incidental connection. Dividend income, interest on short-term deposits, and service charges, in this context, were deemed to be second-degree receipts, not \"derived from\" long-term finance.\n\n### Implications for Financial Institutions and Future Tax Planning\n\nThis judgment is a significant landmark for all financial institutions claiming deductions under Section 36(1)(viii). *Ab samay aa gaya hai* for a thorough re-evaluation of income classification.\n\n*   **Rethink Income Segregation:** Financial institutions must meticulously segregate their income streams. Only profits directly and intimately connected with providing long-term finance (as defined in the Explanation) will qualify.\n*   **Stricter Scrutiny by Tax Authorities:** Expect tax authorities to scrutinize claims under Section 36(1)(viii) with renewed vigor, strictly adhering to the \"direct nexus\" principle laid down by the Supreme Court. *Idhar-udhar ka income ab nahi chalega.*\n*   **Impact on Treasury Operations:** Income generated from treasury operations, particularly short-term investments of surplus funds, will likely be excluded from eligible profits for this deduction.\n*   **Dividend Income:** Dividend income from investments, even if held for business purposes, will generally not be considered \"derived from\" long-term finance.\n*   **Review of Accounting Practices:** While book entries might categorize all as business income, for tax purposes under Section 36(1)(viii), the *source* and *directness* of the income will be paramount.\n\n### Final Thoughts: A Clearer Path, Albeit Narrower\n\nThe Supreme Court's pronouncement on \"derived from\" for Section 36(1)(viii) has certainly provided clarity, though it's a narrower path for assessees. It reaffirms the long-standing judicial principle that beneficial tax provisions must be interpreted strictly, adhering to the legislative intent. For financial institutions, this means a recalibration of their tax strategies and a deeper understanding of what truly constitutes profits directly flowing from their core long-term financing business. This judgment serves as a crucial reminder: when the law says \"derived from,\" it means exactly that – a direct and immediate origin, not just an incidental association.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Visit the Income Tax Department, Government of India website](https://www.incometax.gov.in)\n\n*Published on: 13 December 2025*",
