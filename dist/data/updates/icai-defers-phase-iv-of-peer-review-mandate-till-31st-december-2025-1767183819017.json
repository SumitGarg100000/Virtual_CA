  "content": "# ICAI Defers Phase IV of Peer Review Mandate till 31st December 2025!\n\nEk important update hai for all Practice Units! The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) ne Peer Review Mandate ke Phase IV ki implementation date defer kar di hai. This decision gives more time for compliance, especially for firms covered under this phase.\n\nHere are the key details:\n\n*   **Original Mandate Date (Phase IV):** Phase IV was originally mandated to be applicable from April 2025.\n*   **New Mandate Date (Phase IV):** The Peer Review Certificate will now be mandatory for Practice Units covered under Phase IV from **January 1, 2026**. This effectively defers the requirement until December 31, 2025.\n*   **Deferment Period:** The ICAI Council ने Phase IV के लिए deadline ko 9 months se extend kiya hai.\n*   **Applicability for Phase IV:** This phase covers Practice Units undertaking audits of branches of Public Sector Banks and those with three or more partners providing attestation services. These units need to obtain a Peer Review Certificate before accepting statutory audits.\n*   **Official Announcement Date:** This deferment was announced by ICAI on **January 22, 2025**.\n\nThis move reflects ICAI's consideration of feedback from Practice Units and its commitment to ensuring a smooth transition towards enhanced quality assurance in audit and attestation services.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.icai.org/post/deferment-of-phase-iii-and-iv-of-peer-review-mandate-22-01-2025)\n\n*Published on: 31 December 2025*",
