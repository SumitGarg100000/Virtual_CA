Income Tax Department ne non-audited business cases aur specific trusts ke liye Income Tax Return (ITR) filing ki due date ko extend karne ki clarification announce ki hai. This extension is a significant relief for many taxpayers.\n\nYe extension Financial Year 2025-26 (Assessment Year 2026-27) ke liye applicable hai.\n\n*   **Old Due Date:** Generally, the due date for these categories was July 31, 2026.\n*   **New Due Date:** The revised due date is **August 31, 2026**.\n*   **Applicability:** This extension specifically benefits non-audited business cases and certain trusts. Salaried individuals filing ITR-1 or ITR-2 will continue to have July 31, 2026, as their due date.\n*   **Reason for Extension:** The government has extended the due date to ease compliance, reduce the last-minute rush, and allow for smoother filing under the new Income Tax Act framework, which comes into effect from April 1, 2026. This change is part of the Budget 2026 updates and involves amendments to relevant sections of the Income Tax Act, 2025, and similar amendments in the Income Tax Act, 1961.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/latest-news)\n\n*Published on: 4 February 2026*",
