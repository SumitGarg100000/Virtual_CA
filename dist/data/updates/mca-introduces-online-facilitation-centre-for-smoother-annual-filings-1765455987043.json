  "content": "# MCA Introduces Online Facilitation Centre for Smoother Annual Filings\n\nEk important update hai for all companies and professionals! The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) ne annual filings ko timely aur error-free banane ke liye ek naya Online Facilitation Centre (OFC) introduce kiya hai.\n\nThis initiative aims to streamline the filing process, especially with the ongoing transition and adaptation to the MCA21 Version 3 portal. It's a proactive step by the government to address compliance challenges and ensure stakeholders get the necessary support during annual filings for forms like AOC-4 and MGT-7.\n\n**Key Features of the Online Facilitation Centre:**\n\n*   **Dedicated Email Support:** Stakeholders ab apne queries ya issues dedicated email (ddegov@mca.gov.in) par bhej sakte hain. Screenshots aur ticket number ke saath detailed information share karne par, OFC team unhe analyse karegi.\n*   **Daily Video Conferencing Sessions:** Technical aur domain related issues ko effectively resolve karne ke liye, MCA daily video conferencing sessions conduct karega. Yeh sessions 2:30 PM se 5 PM tak honge. In sessions mein LTIM technical aur domain personnel ke saath eGov representatives aur relevant institutes ke resources bhi available rahenge, for quick solutions. Video conferencing link MCA ke social media handles par share kiya jayega.\n\nThis move is expected to significantly ease the burden on companies and professionals, ensuring a smoother compliance experience.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Visit the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) Website for Updates](https://www.mca.gov.in/)\n\n*Published on: 11 December 2025*",
