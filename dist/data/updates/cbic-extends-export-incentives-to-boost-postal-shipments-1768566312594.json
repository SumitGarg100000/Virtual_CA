  "content": "# CBIC Extends Export Incentives to Boost Postal Shipments!\n\nEk important update hai! Government ne export incentives jaise Duty Drawback, RoDTEP, aur RoSCTL ko ab postal shipments par bhi extend kar diya hai. Yeh ek major policy push hai, especially for our MSME exporters jo remote areas se operate karte hain aur India Post par rely karte hain.\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n*   **What's New:** Exporters using the postal route can now claim benefits under the Duty Drawback, Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP), and Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) schemes.\n*   **Effective Date:** Yeh changes January 15, 2026, se effective ho gaye hain.\n*   **Why This is Important:** Isse postal channel ke through exports karne wale exporters ko level playing field milega aur cross-border e-commerce ko boost milega. It will significantly enhance the competitiveness of MSME exporters.\n*   **Operational Details:** Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) ne iske liye Postal Export (Electronic Declaration and Processing) Regulations, 2022 mein amendments approve kiye hain.\n*   **Official Documents:**\n    *   Notification No. 07/2026–Customs (N.T.) dated January 15, 2026, amends the regulations.\n    *   Circular No. 01/2026–Customs dated January 15, 2026, explains the amendments and operational modalities.\n\nYeh कदम small sellers, artisans, aur first-time exporters ke liye bahut helpful hoga.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2089456)\n\n*Published on: 16 January 2026*",
