  "content": "# Supreme Court Strikes Down 25-Year CA Practice Requirement for ITAT Accountant Members\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has declared unconstitutional the requirement for Chartered Accountants (CAs) to have 25 years of practice to be appointed as Accountant Members in the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT).\n\nKey points of the ruling:\n*   A Bench comprising Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K. Vinod Chandran delivered the judgment.\n*   The decision clarifies a previous ruling in the \"Madras Bar Association v. Union of India\" case, which had invalidated parts of the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021.\n*   The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) sought this clarification, arguing for parity with advocates, for whom a similar age-based restriction for tribunal appointments was previously struck down.\n*   The Court reasoned that a 25-year practice requirement would effectively make CAs eligible only around the age of 50, mirroring the age restriction already deemed unconstitutional for advocates.\n*   The Court stated there is \"no justification to maintain an onerous condition for Chartered Accountants when a similar requirement for advocates has been invalidated.\"",
