The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) ne postal mode se kiye jaane wale exports ke liye bhi export incentives ko extend karne ka announcement kiya hai. This is a significant move that will definitely help our MSME and e-commerce exporters.\n\nHere are the key details:\n\n*   **What's New:** Earlier, getting export benefits for goods sent via postal mode was a bit tricky. Ab, exporters electronic form mein postal shipments ke through bhi Duty Drawback, Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP), aur Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) schemes ke under benefits claim kar sakte hain.\n*   **Effective Date:** Yeh changes **January 15, 2026** se लागू ho gaye hain.\n*   **Why This Matters:** This decision aims to create a level playing field for exporters using the postal channel and will significantly enhance the competitiveness of MSME exporters, especially those from smaller towns and remote areas. It's a big boost for cross-border e-commerce in India.\n*   **Official Communication:** These amendments have been operationalized through **Notification No. 07/2026–Customs (N.T.)** and **Circular No. 01/2026 –Customs**, both dated **January 15, 2026**. The Notification amends the Postal Export (Electronic Declaration and Processing) Regulations, 2022.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Circular No. 01/2026-Customs here](https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/customs/cs-circulars/cs-circulars-2026/Circular-No-01-2026-Customs.pdf)\n\n*Published on: 17 January 2026*",
