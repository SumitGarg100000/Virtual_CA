In the dynamic world of Indian indirect taxation, clarity, especially around exemptions, is a commodity more precious than gold. For far too long, the GST implications on residential premises leased out as hostels have been a grey area, leading to much confusion and litigation. Many property owners and hostel aggregators have been scratching their heads, wondering if their rental income from providing a roof over students' and working professionals' heads would attract the dreaded 18% GST.\n\nWell, good news, doston! The Hon'ble Supreme Court has finally delivered a landmark judgment on December 4, 2025, bringing much-needed relief and definitive clarity. In a significant pronouncement, the Apex Court has upheld the Goods and Services Tax (GST) exemption for residential premises leased for use as hostels. This ruling is a game-changer, reaffirming the legislative intent behind the exemption and setting aside a series of contradictory Advance Rulings. Let's deep dive into what this means for us.\n\n## The Factual Matrix: Understanding the Genesis of the Dispute\n\nThe whole *mamla* started with a property co-owner in Bengaluru who leased out a 42-room residential building to an entity, M/s DTwelve Spaces Private Limited. This company, an aggregator, in turn, sub-leased these rooms as long-term hostel accommodation to students and working women. The stays typically ranged from three to eleven months, clearly indicating a long-term residential pattern rather than a temporary hotel-like stay.\n\nSeeking clarity on the GST applicability, the property owner approached the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR), Karnataka.\n\n## The Legal Labyrinth: Disputed Provisions and the Revenue's Stance\n\nThe core of the dispute revolved around **Entry 13 of Notification No. 9/2017-Integrated Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017** (and its Central Tax counterpart, Entry 12 of Notification No. 12/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017), which provides an exemption for \"services by way of renting of residential dwelling for use as residence.\"\n\nThe Revenue authorities, via the AAR and subsequently the Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR), denied the exemption. Their primary arguments were twofold:\n*   Firstly, they contended that a \"hostel\" or \"paying guest accommodation\" is not a \"residential dwelling\" but rather a commercial establishment.\n*   Secondly, they argued that the exemption required the *lessee* (in this case, DTwelve Spaces Private Limited, a company) to *personally* use the premises as its residence, which, naturally, a corporate entity cannot do. Since the company was sub-leasing for commercial purposes, the exemption was deemed inapplicable.\n\nThis narrow interpretation by the Advance Ruling authorities created significant uncertainty across the country, as similar business models are prevalent everywhere. Many feared that such an interpretation would eventually lead to an 18% GST burden on the entire chain, making residential accommodation more expensive for students and working professionals.\n\nHowever, the Karnataka High Court stepped in, taking a broader view and ruling in favour of the assessee, stating that hostels used for long-stay accommodation *do* constitute a \"residential dwelling\" and that the notification does not mandate personal occupation by the lessee. Dissatisfied, the State of Karnataka appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\n## The Apex Court's Verdict: A Breath of Fresh Air\n\nIn a judgment delivered by a Division Bench comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and K.V. Viswanathan, the Supreme Court unequivocally dismissed the appeals, thereby upholding the Karnataka High Court's decision. This ruling confirms that renting out residential premises for use as hostels, particularly for long-term stays by students and working professionals, is indeed exempt from GST for the period prior to the July 2022 amendment.\n\n*Hogaya na tension free?* This decision has brought immense clarity and a much-needed sigh of relief to landlords, property aggregators, and ultimately, the students and working professionals who rely on such accommodations.\n\n## Unpacking the Supreme Court's Rationale: A Deep Dive\n\nThe Supreme Court's reasoning is both robust and rooted in the true spirit of the GST law. Let's break down the key findings:\n\n### 1. Hostel as a 'Residential Dwelling'\nThe Court clarified that the term \"**residential dwelling**\" should be understood in its common parlance. It's not explicitly defined in the GST law, so we must rely on established jurisprudence. The Apex Court held that any residential accommodation meant for long-term stay, where individuals (like students or working women) eat, sleep, and live, unequivocally qualifies as a residential dwelling. The property's municipal classification as residential and the long-term stay patterns further bolstered this interpretation. This effectively demolishes the argument that hostels are inherently commercial and therefore outside the ambit of \"residential dwelling.\"\n\n### 2. Lessee's Occupation: Not a Prerequisite\nPerhaps the most critical aspect of the ruling is the Court's stance on the lessee's personal occupation. The Revenue's argument that the company (DTwelve Spaces Pvt. Ltd.) must *personally* reside in the premises for the exemption to apply was rejected. The Court emphasized that Entry 13 (or 12) **contains no such condition** requiring the lessee's personal use. To impose such a requirement would be akin to \"judicial redrafting\" of the exemption entry, which is not permissible. The ultimate use by the sub-lessees (students/working women) as their residence is what matters.\n\n### 3. Purposive Interpretation & Legislative Intent\nThe Supreme Court applied the doctrine of **purposive interpretation**. It highlighted that the exemption's legislative intent is to keep residential accommodation affordable by not burdening it with GST. Imposing an 18% GST on the transaction between the owner and the aggregator would inevitably be passed on to the students and working professionals, thereby **defeating the very purpose** of the exemption. *Baat toh sahi hai, na?* If the ultimate beneficiary is paying the tax, the exemption loses its meaning.\n\n### 4. Activity-Specific, Not Person-Specific Exemption\nThe Court stressed that the exemption is \"**activity-specific**\" and not \"person-specific.\" This means the nature of the activity (renting a residential dwelling for residence) is what triggers the exemption, not the legal status or the commercial motive of the person/entity leasing the property. Whether the lessee is an individual or a company, if the ultimate use of the property is residential, the exemption holds.\n\n### 5. Prospective Application of 2022 Amendment\nIt's crucial to remember that this judgment primarily applies to the period **prior to July 18, 2022**. The Court specifically held that the **2022 amendment** (Notification No. 04/2022-Central Tax (Rate) dated 13.07.2022, read with Notification No. 05/2022-Central Tax (Rate) dated 13.07.2022), which withdrew the exemption for residential dwellings rented to a *registered person*, operates **prospectively**. This means the Revenue cannot retrospectively deny benefits for the earlier period (2019-2022) based on a subsequent amendment.\n\n## Impact and Way Forward\n\nThis Supreme Court ruling brings immense clarity and relief to:\n*   **Property Owners:** Those leasing out residential properties to aggregators for hostel purposes can rest assured about the GST exemption for past periods.\n*   **Hostel & PG Operators/Aggregators:** Their business model, particularly for long-term stays, now has legal backing regarding the GST exemption for the period covered by the judgment.\n*   **Students & Working Professionals:** The ultimate beneficiaries, who will continue to enjoy more affordable residential accommodation without the burden of an additional 18% GST for the specified period.\n\nWhile the judgment clarifies the position prior to July 18, 2022, it also indirectly reinforces the current scenario *post*-July 18, 2022. If a residential dwelling is rented to a *registered person* (like a company operating a hostel), GST would now be applicable under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM). However, for unregistered individuals renting for their own residence, the exemption continues. The distinction now lies in the **status of the recipient** rather than the nature of the property's use by an intermediary.\n\nThis judgment is a testament to the judiciary's commitment to interpreting tax laws pragmatically and in line with their underlying objectives. It’s a good day for a sensible interpretation of tax statutes!\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://main.sci.gov.in)\n\n*Published on: 8 December 2025*",
