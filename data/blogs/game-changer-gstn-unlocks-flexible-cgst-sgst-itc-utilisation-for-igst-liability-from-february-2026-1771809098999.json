It’s a classic scenario: you have a healthy balance of CGST and SGST credit in your electronic credit ledger, yet you’re forced to pay your IGST liability in cash because the system dictates a rigid order of set-off. *Bada frustration hota tha, nahi?* This often led to blocked working capital and unnecessary cash outflows, even when sufficient credit was technically available.\n\nWell, get ready for some relief! The Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) has rolled out a crucial enhancement, effective from the **February 2026 tax period**, which promises to bring much-needed flexibility. This isn't just a minor tweak; it's a significant step towards streamlining compliance and improving cash flow for businesses across India.\n\n## Understanding the Evolution of ITC Utilisation: From Rigidity to Reason\n\nBefore we dive into the new development, let's quickly recap how things stood and why this change is so impactful.\n\n### The Earlier Rigidity (Pre-February 2026 Portal Logic)\n\nPreviously, while settling your **Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) liability**, after exhausting your available **IGST Input Tax Credit (ITC)**, the system mandated a specific, waterfall-like order for utilising your **Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) ITC** and **State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) ITC**. You had to first utilise all your available CGST ITC towards the remaining IGST liability, and *only then* could you touch your SGST ITC.\n\nThis rigid sequence often created a practical challenge. Imagine a business with substantial SGST credit but limited CGST credit, facing a significant IGST liability. They would be compelled to pay the balance IGST liability in cash, leaving their SGST credit unutilised, effectively *phas gaya paisa*. This trapped credit scenario was a constant pain point, impacting liquidity and requiring intricate planning to avoid such blockages.\n\n### The Spirit of Rule 88A: A Provision Awaiting Full Implementation\n\nInterestingly, the legal framework, specifically **Rule 88A of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Rules, 2017**, already provided for greater flexibility. This rule, introduced way back in 2019, stipulated that after exhausting the IGST credit, the balance IGST liability could be discharged using CGST ITC and SGST ITC \"in any order\". However, the actual functionality on the GST portal didn't fully align with this provision, leading to the rigid sequence we just discussed.\n\nThis gap between the legal provision and its practical implementation on the portal was a subject of much discussion and representation from the trade and industry.\n\n### The Latest Game Changer: GSTN's Announcement (February 19, 2026)\n\n*Aur ab aayi hai asali khabar!* On February 19, 2026, GSTN issued an update (Advisory No. 649) clarifying that the functionality to utilise CGST or SGST ITC for payment of IGST liability, in any order after complete exhaustion of IGST credit, shall be available from the **February 2026 tax period onwards**. This means the portal logic has finally caught up with the spirit of Rule 88A, granting taxpayers the flexibility they've long sought.\n\n## How Does It Work Now? (The New Provision)\n\nLet's break down the revised order of utilisation:\n\n1.  **First Priority: IGST ITC against IGST Liability.** This remains unchanged. You must first fully utilise all available **IGST ITC** to discharge your **IGST liability**. *Yeh toh mandatory hai.*\n2.  **Next Priority: Flexible CGST/SGST ITC against Remaining IGST Liability.** Once your IGST ITC is fully exhausted and there's still a balance in your IGST liability, you now have the power to choose! You can utilise your available **CGST ITC** and **SGST ITC** in **any order and in any proportion** to settle the remaining IGST liability.\n\nHere's a quick comparison of the old and new provisions:\n\n| Feature                   | Old Portal Logic (Pre-Feb 2026)                                                                                                   | New Portal Logic (From Feb 2026)                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Step 1 (IGST vs IGST)** | Mandatory: IGST ITC fully utilised against IGST liability.                                                                        | Mandatory: IGST ITC fully utilised against IGST liability.                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **Step 2 (CGST/SGST vs IGST)** | Fixed Order: CGST ITC had to be fully utilised first, followed by SGST ITC, for remaining IGST liability. | **Flexible Order:** Taxpayers can now choose to utilise CGST ITC or SGST ITC (or a combination) in **any desired order or proportion** for the remaining IGST liability. |\n\n### A Practical Perspective: *Samjho ab kya fayda hoga!*\n\nConsider a taxpayer with:\n*   IGST Liability: ₹10,00,000\n*   IGST ITC: ₹4,00,000\n*   CGST ITC: ₹1,00,000\n*   SGST ITC: ₹5,00,000\n\n**Under the old system:**\n1.  IGST ITC of ₹4,00,000 would be used against IGST liability. Remaining IGST liability: ₹6,00,000.\n2.  CGST ITC of ₹1,00,000 would *then* be mandatorily used. Remaining IGST liability: ₹5,00,000.\n3.  SGST ITC of ₹5,00,000 would *then* be used. IGST liability settled.\n    *   Result: CGST ITC fully used, SGST ITC fully used.\n\n**Under the new flexible system:**\n1.  IGST ITC of ₹4,00,000 would be used against IGST liability. Remaining IGST liability: ₹6,00,000.\n2.  Now, the taxpayer has a choice!\n    *   Scenario A: If the taxpayer anticipates a higher future **SGST liability** and wishes to preserve SGST credit, they can choose to utilise more **CGST ITC** against the IGST liability (up to ₹1,00,000 available) and then use the remaining from SGST.\n    *   Scenario B: If the taxpayer anticipates a higher future **CGST liability** and wishes to preserve CGST credit, they can opt to use all available **SGST ITC** (₹5,00,000) against the IGST liability, leaving the CGST ITC untouched for future CGST payments. The remaining IGST liability (₹1,00,000) would then be met by the available CGST ITC.\n    *   Or any combination that suits their cash flow and future liabilities.\n\nThis flexibility allows businesses to optimise their ITC utilisation and prevent situations where credit in one head (especially SGST) remains idle while cash is paid for another, simply due to a predefined sequence.\n\n## Why This Matters: Benefits for Taxpayers\n\nThis update is not just a procedural change; it has several tangible benefits:\n\n*   **Improved Cash Flow Management:** The most immediate and significant benefit. Businesses can strategically utilise their credits to minimise cash payments, thereby freeing up working capital. *Ab paisa block nahi hoga!*\n*   **Reduced Blocked Credit:** Especially beneficial for taxpayers who might accumulate excess SGST credit due to the nature of their intra-state procurements and inter-state supplies (leading to IGST liability). They can now efficiently use this SGST credit.\n*   **Enhanced Ease of Doing Business:** Simpler compliance and less need for complex workarounds to manage credit balances. The system is becoming more taxpayer-friendly.\n*   **Strategic ITC Planning:** Taxpayers and their advisors can now plan their ITC utilisation more effectively, aligning it with their anticipated future liabilities and cash flow requirements.\n\n## Key Takeaways for Businesses\n\nThis new functionality is a welcome change that empowers taxpayers with greater control over their ITC utilisation. As a professional, here’s what you should advise your clients:\n\n*   **Be Aware of the Effective Date:** The new functionality is applicable for returns filed for the **February 2026 tax period onwards**. Ensure your team is aware of this change for your upcoming GSTR-3B filings.\n*   **Review Your ITC Balances:** Regularly analyse your CGST, SGST, and IGST ITC balances to strategise the most optimal utilisation for your IGST liabilities.\n*   **Optimise Your Cash Outflow:** Use this flexibility to reduce unnecessary cash payments.\n*   **Stay Informed:** GST is dynamic. Keep an eye on official GSTN advisories and notifications for any further updates or clarifications.\n\nThe GST regime is constantly evolving, and these portal enhancements, aligning functionality with existing legal provisions, are always a positive sign. This particular move is a practical relief that will surely be appreciated by the taxpayer community.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.gst.gov.in/newsandupdates/read/649)\n\n*Published on: 23 February 2026*",
