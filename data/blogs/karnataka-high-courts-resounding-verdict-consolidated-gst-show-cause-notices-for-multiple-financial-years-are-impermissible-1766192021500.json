It's a procedural headache, often leading to confusion and severely hampering a taxpayer's ability to mount a robust defense. But now, the Karnataka High Court has stepped in with a significant ruling, bringing much-needed clarity and relief. In a judgment dated December 11, 2025 (and reaffirmed in later pronouncements), the High Court has categorically held this practice as impermissible, asserting that each financial year must be treated as a distinct unit for adjudication under GST law.\n\nThis isn't just another court case; it's a landmark decision that could reshape how demand proceedings are conducted across the country. Many times, you might have received a single, thick SCN covering several financial years, making it almost impossible to dissect year-wise allegations, reconcile data, and effectively respond within the stipulated time. *Aapko lagta hoga ki yeh toh ek dum 'mix-up' ho gaya hai*, right? This judgment directly addresses that very concern.\n\n## Unpacking the Legal Labyrinth: Why Clubbing Was Always Problematic\n\nTo truly appreciate the Karnataka High Court's stance, let's revisit the fundamental principles of the **Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (CGST Act)** and why the 'one-SCN-for-all-years' approach created more problems than it solved.\n\n### The Problem of Distinct Causes of Action and Limitation\n\nSections **73** (determination of tax not paid or short paid or erroneously refunded or input tax credit wrongly availed or utilised for reasons other than fraud or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts) and **74** (similar determination for cases involving fraud, wilful misstatement or suppression of facts) of the CGST Act are the bedrock for issuing SCNs. Crucially, both sections prescribe specific **time limits** for the issuance of orders, which are tied to the **due date for furnishing the annual return for the financial year to which the tax relates**.\n\n*   For Section 73 cases, the order must generally be issued within three years from the due date of the annual return for the relevant financial year.\n*   For Section 74 cases, this period extends to five years.\n\nNow, imagine an SCN covering, say, FY 2017-18, FY 2018-19, and FY 2019-20. The limitation period for each of these financial years is distinct. Clubbing them into one notice means the department might be attempting to overcome the limitation for an earlier year by piggybacking it with a later, active year. This practice fundamentally distorts the statutory scheme of limitation and makes it incredibly difficult for the taxpayer to argue year-specific defenses, including claims that certain demands are time-barred.\n\nFurthermore, the very definition of \"tax period\" under **Section 2(106)** of the CGST Act refers to the period for which a return is required to be furnished, which is typically monthly or annually, but **never a multi-year block**. Each financial year, therefore, forms an independent unit for assessment.\n\n### Violation of Natural Justice and Procedural Fairness\n\nWhen multiple years are combined, the SCN often becomes voluminous and generic, making it challenging to present year-wise rebuttals and evidence. The facts, transactions, and even applicable legal provisions might differ subtly from one year to the next. A consolidated SCN deprives the taxpayer of the right to provide year-wise explanations and defenses, leading to serious prejudice. *Sahi batao, kitna mushkil ho jaata hai, isn't it?*\n\nMoreover, the clubbing can lead to misclassification. If some allegations pertain to Section 73 (non-fraud) and others to Section 74 (fraud), a consolidated notice might wrongly apply the extended limitation and higher penalties of Section 74 to all years, blurring statutory distinctions that are crucial for determining liability and penalty.\n\n## The Karnataka High Court's Unequivocal Stance\n\nThe Karnataka High Court, in its recent pronouncements, including the judgment dated December 11, 2025, has firmly put its foot down on this issue. Drawing upon precedents and a detailed analysis of the CGST Act, the Court has consistently held that issuing a single, composite show cause notice covering multiple financial years is **illegal, without jurisdiction, and contrary to the statutory scheme**.\n\nSpecifically, the Court has reasoned that:\n*   **Each financial year is an independent unit for assessment:** The structure of Sections 73 and 74, read with the definition of 'tax period', mandates that limitation, assessment, and enforcement are intrinsically year-specific.\n*   **Clubbing defeats the statutory limitation scheme:** By combining years, the department could indirectly bypass the specific limitation periods applicable to each financial year, thereby infringing upon a fundamental right of the taxpayer.\n*   **Prejudice to the assessee:** A consolidated SCN hinders the taxpayer's ability to present year-specific defenses, reconcile accounts, and address different tax positions, exemptions, or ITC claims that might vary across years. This constitutes a violation of the principles of natural justice.\n*   **Jurisdictional overreach:** The act of clubbing multiple years in a single notice goes beyond the powers granted to the tax authorities under the CGST Act.\n\nThe Karnataka High Court has reiterated this position in various cases, such as *Veremax Technologie Services Ltd. vs. Assistant Commissioner, GST Bengaluru*, *Bangalore Golf Club vs. Assistant Commissioner, GST Bengaluru*, and *M/s Chimney Hills Education Society*, all of which quashed consolidated SCNs. More recently, in *M/s. Pramur Homes And Shelters Versus The Union of India*, the Court meticulously analyzed the provisions and affirmed that \"the expression 'any period' used in Sections 73/74 can only mean a 'tax period', i.e., a period for which a return is required to be furnished—monthly or annually—but never more than one financial year at a time.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that while other High Courts, like the Madras High Court, have taken a similar stance, there have been divergent views from some High Courts, such as the Delhi High Court, which in some cases, particularly involving fraudulent ITC schemes, permitted multi-year SCNs. However, the Karnataka High Court's position is clear and unwavering, aligning with the spirit of period-specific assessments.\n\n## Implications for Taxpayers and the Department\n\nThis judgment by the Karnataka High Court is a game-changer.\n*   **For Taxpayers:** If you receive an SCN that clubs multiple financial years, you now have a strong legal ground to challenge its validity. It reinforces your right to receive year-specific notices, allowing for a more focused and effective defense. *Yeh toh ek bada 'boon' hai apne liye!*\n*   **For the Department:** Revenue authorities in Karnataka, and ideally across India, will need to revise their SCN issuance practices. They must now ensure that notices are issued for each financial year separately, strictly adhering to the individual limitation periods and ensuring procedural fairness. While the Court has quashed consolidated notices, it has also reserved liberty for the department to initiate fresh proceedings year-wise, in accordance with the law.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe Karnataka High Court's ruling on the impermissibility of clubbing multiple financial years in a single GST Show Cause Notice is a welcome development. It underscores the importance of procedural propriety and adherence to statutory timelines, ensuring that taxpayers are accorded a fair opportunity to respond to allegations. This judgment will undoubtedly bring more clarity, accountability, and efficiency to GST demand proceedings. It's a clear signal that **process matters**, and any deviation that prejudices the taxpayer will not stand judicial scrutiny.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Access the Karnataka High Court Judgments here](https://karnatakajudiciary.kar.nic.in/caseOrders.asp)\n\n*Published on: 20 December 2025*",
