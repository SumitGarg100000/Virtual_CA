Imagine a situation where your client, completely unaware of any ongoing proceedings, suddenly receives a demand notice, only to discover that the department proceeded *ex-parte* because a notice uploaded on the GST portal went unresponded. *Frustrating, isn't it?* This isn't just about technicalities; it strikes at the very core of natural justice.\n\nThe good news is, the Madras High Court has once again stepped in as a beacon of fairness. In a significant judgment dated December 29, 2025, in the case of **S.P. Forms v. Deputy State Tax Officer**, the Hon'ble Court has unequivocally mandated that tax officers *must* explore alternate modes of service for GST notices before resorting to *ex-parte* orders. This ruling is a breath of fresh air, reinforcing the fundamental principle that procedural compliance cannot override effective communication.\n\n### The Problem with \"Portal-Only\" Service\n\nFor a while now, there's been a growing concern among taxpayers and practitioners alike regarding the department's increasing reliance on the GST common portal for serving notices. While the portal is undoubtedly a crucial tool for digital governance and efficiency, the ground reality for many businesses, especially smaller ones or those with limited digital literacy, often means they might not constantly check the 'Additional Notices and Orders' tab. This oversight, inadvertently, leads to non-response, which the department then cites to pass *ex-parte* assessment orders.\n\nMany a time, the notices might be uploaded, reminders sent, and even personal hearing intimations posted – all on the portal. If the taxpayer remains unaware or unresponsive through this sole mode, the officer proceeds to confirm the proposed demand, leaving the taxpayer in a lurch. This approach, while seemingly compliant on paper, often falls short of ensuring the taxpayer has actual knowledge of the proceedings against them.\n\n### The S.P. Forms Judgment: A Deep Dive into the Court's Stance\n\nThe Madras High Court's ruling in **S.P. Forms v. Deputy State Tax Officer** on December 29, 2025, addresses this very predicament head-on.\n\n*   **Facts of the Case:** In this particular instance, the taxpayer, S.P. Forms, challenged an *ex-parte* assessment order. Their contention was clear: they had not received effective notice of the proceedings, even though notices were uploaded on the GST portal. The tax officer, finding no response, proceeded to pass the assessment order *ex-parte*.\n*   **Legal Provisions under Scrutiny:** The core of the legal analysis revolved around **Section 169 of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017**. This section meticulously outlines various valid modes of service for any decision, order, summons, notice, or other communication under the Act. These modes include:\n    *   Direct delivery (personally or by messenger/courier).\n    *   Registered post or speed post or courier with acknowledgment due.\n    *   Sending a communication to the e-mail address provided.\n    *   Making it available on the common portal.\n    *   Publication in a newspaper circulating in the locality.\n    *   Affixing it at the last known place of business.\n\n*   **The Court's Decision and Rationale:** The Madras High Court, after careful deliberation, sided with the petitioner. It emphatically held that while uploading notices on the GST portal is indeed a valid mode of service under Section 169, it is *not* an absolute or sufficient mode, especially when the taxpayer remains unresponsive. The Court stressed that tax officers **must apply their mind** and actively explore alternate modes of service prescribed under Section 169 of the CGST Act before concluding that service is complete and proceeding *ex-parte*.\n\n    The judgment underscored the cardinal principle of **natural justice**, emphasizing that taxpayers deserve a fair opportunity to present their case. Merely fulfilling a procedural formality of portal upload, without ensuring that the taxpayer has actual knowledge of the notice, defeats the very purpose of adjudication and leads to avoidable litigation. The Court highlighted that if taxpayers do not respond to portal communications, officers have a duty to exhaust other statutory methods, such as sending notices via registered post with acknowledgment due (RPAD) or to the registered email address.\n\n### What Does This Mean for You and Your Clients?\n\nThis judgment has significant implications for both taxpayers and the tax administration:\n\n*   **For Taxpayers:** This provides a crucial safeguard against arbitrary *ex-parte* orders. If your client faces an *ex-parte* order where only portal service was attempted, this judgment arms you with a strong legal ground to challenge it. It means that the department cannot simply wash their hands of the responsibility of effective communication.\n*   **For Tax Officers:** It reinforces their duty to exercise diligence and ensure that notices effectively reach the taxpayer. It's a clear directive to not just tick a box but to genuinely ensure adherence to the principles of natural justice. They need to **explore *all* available options** under Section 169 when initial portal service yields no response. This could mean sending a physical notice via registered post or an email to the registered email ID, rather than jumping straight to an *ex-parte* order.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Madras High Court, in numerous other similar cases throughout 2025 (e.g., *Sakthi Steel Trading*, *Namasivaya Auto Parts*, *Tvl. Fashion Falls Fabrics*, *Tvl. Iyarkai*), has consistently set aside *ex-parte* orders where effective communication was lacking. Often, these remands come with a condition of pre-deposit (e.g., 10%, 25%, or even 50%) of the disputed tax amount, balancing taxpayer relief with revenue protection.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThis latest judgment from the Madras High Court is a timely reminder that while technology streamlines processes, it cannot overshadow fundamental legal principles. The balance between digital efficiency and natural justice is delicate, and the Court has once again emphasized that the latter cannot be compromised. As professionals, this gives us greater clarity and a stronger position when dealing with cases of *ex-parte* assessments arising from ineffective service. It's time for the department to update their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), *agar woh abhi tak nahin kiya hai toh*, to ensure they comply with the spirit, not just the letter, of Section 169.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/index.php)\n\n*Published on: 1 January 2026*",
