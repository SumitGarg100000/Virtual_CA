  "content": "# GST Game Changer: Central Govt. Mandates RSP-Based Valuation for Specified Goods – Decoding the Dec 31, 2025 Notification\n\nAs Chartered Accountants and legal analysts, we're all constantly navigating the dynamic landscape of Goods and Services Tax (GST). Just when we thought we had a handle on valuation principles, the Central Government has brought in a significant change that demands our immediate attention. On December 31, 2025, two crucial notifications (No. 19/2025–Central Tax and No. 20/2025–Central Tax) were issued, ushering in a new era of **Retail Sale Price (RSP)-based valuation** for certain specified goods, effective from February 1, 2026. This isn't just another amendment; it's a fundamental shift for affected businesses. Let's deep dive into what this means, why it's happening, and how to prepare.\n\n## The Naya Niyam: What the Notification Says\n\nAt its core, the new regime introduces **Rule 31D** into the **Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Rules, 2017**, through the Central Goods and Services Tax (Fifth Amendment) Rules, 2025. This rule, read in conjunction with an amendment to Notification No. 49/2023–Central Tax (issued under **Section 15(5) of the CGST Act, 2017**), unequivocally states that for a specific category of goods, the **value of supply** will no longer be determined solely by the transaction value. Instead, it will be deemed to be the **Retail Sale Price (RSP)** declared on such goods, reduced by the amount of applicable tax.\n\nThe \"specified goods\" under this new Rule 31D are explicitly enumerated and primarily include products such as:\n*   Pan masala\n*   Unmanufactured tobacco (excluding tobacco leaves)\n*   Cigars, cheroots, and cigarillos\n*   Other manufactured tobacco and tobacco substitutes\n*   Products containing tobacco or nicotine substitutes intended for inhalation without combustion\n\nThese goods fall under specific tariff headings (e.g., 2106, 2401, 2402, 2403, and 2404 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975).\n\nThe notification also provides a clear definition of \"Retail Sale Price,\" clarifying it as the **maximum price declared on the package, inclusive of all taxes, duties, cess, or surcharges**. A crucial point to note is that if multiple retail sale prices are declared, the highest price shall be considered for valuation purposes. Furthermore, any increase in the declared retail sale price at any stage before, during, or after supply will also be considered for valuation. This makes it abundantly clear that RSP is now the cornerstone for GST computation for these items.\n\n## Why This Change Now? The Rationale Behind the Move\n\nOne might ask, \"Why this sudden shift when we've been operating on transaction value for so long?\". The move is primarily aimed at plugging revenue leakages, minimizing valuation disputes, and ensuring greater compliance, especially in sectors that have historically faced challenges with under-invoicing or complex distribution channels.\n\nFor these high-revenue, often \"sin goods\" sectors, a fixed RSP-based valuation offers several advantages:\n*   **Revenue Certainty:** It provides a predictable tax base, making revenue collection more robust for the government.\n*   **Reduced Litigation:** By standardizing the valuation method, it aims to reduce protracted disputes arising from subjective interpretations of transaction value.\n*   **Level Playing Field:** It aims to prevent unfair competition stemming from varied valuation practices across the industry.\n*   **Alignment with Past Regimes:** This approach echoes the Maximum Retail Price (MRP)-based excise valuation prevalent in the pre-GST era for many such products, making it a familiar concept for some businesses.\n\n## Dissecting the Impact: Who's Affected and How?\n\nThe implications of Rule 31D are far-reaching for manufacturers, distributors, and retailers dealing in the specified goods.\n\n### Old Provision vs. New Provision: A Snapshot\n\nLet's look at how the valuation landscape changes:\n\n| Feature                   | Old Provision (General)                                                                                             | New Provision (for Specified Goods w.e.f. Feb 1, 2026)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Primary Valuation Base** | **Transaction Value** as per **Section 15(1) of CGST Act, 2017**, provided parties are unrelated and price is sole consideration. | **Retail Sale Price (RSP)** declared on the goods, reduced by the amount of applicable tax. This overrides transaction value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **Applicability**         | All goods and services, subject to valuation rules (Rule 27-31) if Section 15(1) conditions are not met. | Only for **specified goods** (pan masala, tobacco products, nicotine substitutes, etc.) as listed under Rule 31D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| **\"Retail Sale Price\"**   | Not a direct valuation determinant under general GST law; MRP is inclusive of all taxes.                     | Defined as the maximum price declared on the package, inclusive of all taxes, duties, cess, or surcharges. Highest RSP considered if multiple exist. Any increase in RSP considered.                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **GST Calculation**       | Based on transaction value (plus inclusions, minus exclusions).                                           | GST payable is to be computed using a reverse calculation formula, as RSP is treated as tax-inclusive: `Tax = (RSP × applicable tax rate) ÷ (100 + applicable tax rate)`. This effectively means GST is extracted from the RSP.                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **Impact on Rule 86B**    | Restrictions on Input Tax Credit (ITC) utilization apply generally.                                      | A corresponding amendment to **Rule 86B** provides relief: registered persons *other than manufacturers* are exempt from certain restrictions *only* for goods covered under Rule 31D, provided the supplier has already discharged tax on an RSP basis. This ensures downstream dealers don't face additional ITC restrictions when tax is already paid on a deemed value. |\n\n### Practical Implications & Challenges Ahead\n\nFor businesses dealing in these specified goods, the changes effective from February 1, 2026, necessitate a comprehensive review of their systems and processes:\n\n*   **IT System Upgrades:** Accounting and billing software will require significant modifications to incorporate the new RSP-based valuation logic and the reverse calculation mechanism for GST. This is not a small feat, *yaar*.\n*   **Pricing Strategy Review:** Manufacturers and importers will need to re-evaluate their pricing strategies to ensure that the declared RSP accurately reflects their final consumer price, as this will now directly influence their GST liability.\n*   **Compliance Protocol:** Internal compliance teams must be trained on the new rules, particularly regarding the definition of RSP, handling multiple RSPs, and the implications of any price revisions.\n*   **Inventory Management:** Clear segregation and tracking of specified goods will be crucial, especially for businesses that deal in both notified and non-notified goods, to avoid valuation errors.\n*   **Anti-Profiteering:** With GST now intrinsically linked to RSP, the **National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA)** (now handled by CCI) could potentially scrutinize any undue price increases more closely, ensuring benefits are passed to consumers.\n*   **Supply Chain Communication:** Clear communication across the supply chain – from manufacturers to distributors to retailers – will be paramount to ensure everyone is on the same page regarding the new valuation method.\n\n## Conclusion: A Step Towards Simplification or Complexity?\n\nThe Central Government's move to notify RSP-based GST valuation for specified goods, effective February 1, 2026, is a bold step. While it aims to simplify valuation and enhance revenue collection for these particular sectors, it simultaneously introduces a distinct valuation methodology that departs from the general transaction value principle. For businesses affected, this will require immediate and diligent action to adapt their systems and processes. A thorough understanding of Rule 31D and its interplay with other GST provisions is no longer optional; it's a compliance imperative. Let's hope this brings the intended clarity and reduces disputes in the long run, making compliance a bit smoother for our clients.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.cbic.gov.in/gst-notifications)\n\n*Published on: 3 January 2026*",
