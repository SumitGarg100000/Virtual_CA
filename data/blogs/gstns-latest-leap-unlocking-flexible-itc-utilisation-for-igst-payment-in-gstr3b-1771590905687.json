As the GST regime continues to evolve, we often find ourselves navigating through changes and updates. Staying abreast of these developments is not just good practice, it's absolutely essential for smooth compliance and efficient cash flow management. Recently, the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) has rolled out a significant enhancement in the **GSTR-3B** filing process, bringing much-needed flexibility to **Input Tax Credit (ITC)** utilisation, especially for **Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST)** payments. This advisory, dated February 20, 2026, is a welcome move that aligns the portal's functionality with statutory provisions, making life a little easier for taxpayers.\n\n## Understanding the ITC Utilisation Conundrum\n\nBefore we delve into the 'what' and 'how' of this new flexibility, let's quickly recap the traditional scenario. Historically, while the law provided for a certain order of ITC utilisation, its practical implementation on the GST portal sometimes presented rigidities. As per **Section 49** of the **CGST Act, 2017**, read with **Rule 88A** of the **CGST Rules, 2017**, ITC on account of IGST is to be first utilised towards payment of IGST, and any remaining balance can then be used for Central Tax (CGST) and State Tax (SGST) or Union Territory Tax (UTGST) in *any order*. Similarly, CGST and SGST/UTGST credits can only be used for IGST liability *after* the IGST ITC has been fully exhausted.\n\nHowever, the sequence of utilising **CGST** and **SGST ITC** towards **IGST** liability, post exhaustion of IGST credit, sometimes lacked system-driven flexibility on the portal. This could, at times, lead to situations where taxpayers had sufficient credit available but faced challenges in optimally adjusting it, potentially forcing them to make cash payments even when ITC was lying idle in their electronic credit ledger.\n\n## The Game-Changer: Flexible ITC Utilisation for IGST\n\nNow, for the good news! The GSTN, through its Advisory No. 649, dated February 20, 2026, has introduced a significant enhancement for taxpayers. Starting from the **February 2026 tax period** onwards, the GST portal will facilitate a more flexible approach for utilising ITC for IGST payments.\n\nSo, what exactly has changed? The key update is that once your available **IGST Input Tax Credit** is *fully exhausted*, you can now utilise your available **CGST ITC** or **SGST ITC** for the payment of your remaining **IGST liability in GSTR-3B** in *any order*. Yes, you read that right – *any order*! This means you have the power to decide how you want to set off your CGST and SGST credits against your IGST dues, giving you more control over your credit balances.\n\nThis enhancement is a direct result of the GSTN aligning the portal's behaviour with the underlying legal provisions, specifically point number 3 of an earlier advisory (Advisory No. 647 dated January 30, 2026) which also discussed interest calculation and other GSTR-3B enhancements.\n\n## Practical Implications for GSTR-3B Filers\n\nThis new flexibility is not just a technical update; it carries significant practical benefits for businesses:\n\n*   **Enhanced Cash Flow Management:** One of the biggest reliefs is the potential reduction in forced cash outflows. Earlier, if you had, say, a huge CGST credit but a small IGST liability, and SGST credit was insufficient, you might have had to pay IGST in cash if the portal didn't allow flexible utilisation of CGST ITC. Now, you can use your CGST or SGST ITC as per your convenience, which is kaafi suvidhajanak.\n*   **Strategic Credit Optimisation:** Businesses can now strategically plan their ITC utilisation to maintain optimal balances across their CGST and SGST ledgers. This is particularly beneficial for businesses with diverse supply chains and credit accumulation patterns. You can choose to deplete the credit you want first, depending on your future liabilities.\n*   **Reduced Compliance Hassle:** This system-driven flexibility aims to reduce procedural bottlenecks and make the GSTR-3B filing process smoother and more intuitive. It minimises manual interventions and the need for complex workarounds to align with the spirit of the law.\n*   **Alignment with Legal Intent:** The move reinforces GSTN's commitment to aligning portal functionalities with statutory provisions, providing greater certainty and reducing disputes related to ITC utilisation.\n\nIt is, however, crucial for taxpayers to carefully review their ITC balances while filing returns for the February 2026 tax period and onwards to ensure precise reporting and compliance.\n\n## A Look Back: The Context of Advisory 647\n\nIt's important to understand that this flexible ITC utilisation update is part of a broader set of enhancements announced by GSTN. Advisory No. 647, issued on January 30, 2026, had already introduced key changes related to interest calculation and the auto-population of the tax liability breakup in GSTR-3B.\n\nFor instance, the interest calculation in Table 5.1 of GSTR-3B has been enhanced to give the benefit of the minimum cash balance available in the Electronic Cash Ledger (ECL) from the due date of return filing until the actual date of tax payment. This aligns with the proviso to **Rule 88B(1) of the CGST Rules, 2017**, ensuring interest is levied only on the net cash liability. So, yeh sab ek bade automation drive ka hissa hai!\n\n## Final Thoughts: A Welcome Move for Taxpayers\n\nThis enablement of flexible ITC utilisation for IGST payment in GSTR-3B is a very positive development for the GST ecosystem. It empowers taxpayers with greater control over their electronic credit ledger, optimises working capital, and simplifies compliance. Such proactive steps by GSTN are always welcome, as they foster a more transparent and taxpayer-friendly environment. Taxpayers and professionals alike should familiarise themselves with these changes to leverage the benefits effectively.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://tutorial.gst.gov.in/downloads/news/advisory_on_interest_calculator.pdf)\n\n*Published on: 20 February 2026*",
