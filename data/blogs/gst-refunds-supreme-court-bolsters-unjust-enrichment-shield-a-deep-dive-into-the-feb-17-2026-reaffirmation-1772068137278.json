Just when you think you've cracked the code for a client, a new interpretation or a fresh judicial pronouncement comes along, adding another layer to the already intricate process. The cornerstone of many refund denials, or rather, the protective wall against undeserved benefits, has always been the doctrine of **\"Unjust Enrichment.\"** And guess what? The Supreme Court, in its judgment dated February 17, 2026, has once again underscored the paramount importance of this principle, sending a clear message across the board.\n\nThis isn't merely a reiteration; it’s a powerful reaffirmation that provides fresh clarity and strengthens the existing jurisprudence surrounding GST refunds. Let's unwrap what this means for us, the businesses, and the tax administration.\n\n## The Genesis of a Principle: \"Unjust Enrichment\" in India's Indirect Tax Regime\n\nThe concept of \"unjust enrichment\" isn't new to Indian tax law, *bilkul nahi*. Its roots run deep, notably solidified by the landmark nine-judge bench decision of the Supreme Court in **Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India (1997)**. This seminal judgment laid down that no person should be allowed to profit at the expense of another without legal justification. In the tax realm, it simply means a taxpayer cannot claim a refund of a tax whose burden they have already passed on to the consumer. If the tax incidence has been shifted, the refund, if due, rightfully belongs to the consumer, not the business. This principle was a guiding light even in the pre-GST era, under Excise and Service Tax regimes.\n\n## Understanding Unjust Enrichment under GST: The Statutory Embodiment\n\nWhen GST rolled out, the architects of the law ensured this equitable principle was firmly embedded within the statute itself. The core idea is simple: if a business has collected tax from its customers, then received a refund of that very tax, it would essentially be enriching itself \"unjustly\" – a classic case of double benefit.\n\nThis principle is primarily enshrined in **Section 54** of the **Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017**, particularly in **sub-sections (5) and (8)**.\n\n*   **Section 54(5)** mandates that a refund can only be paid after due verification that the incidence of tax has not been passed on.\n*   **Section 54(8)** then carves out specific exceptions where this principle *does not* apply. We'll delve into those shortly.\n*   Furthermore, **Section 57** of the CGST Act clearly states that if a refund claim fails the test of unjust enrichment, the amount is not retained as revenue by the government, but instead transferred to the **Consumer Welfare Fund (CWF)**. This fund is then utilized for the welfare of consumers, *achha kadam hai na?*\n\n## The Supreme Court's Reaffirmation: The Judgment of February 17, 2026\n\nThe Supreme Court's pronouncement on February 17, 2026, serves as a powerful reminder that the doctrine of unjust enrichment is not just a procedural formality but a fundamental pillar of the GST refund mechanism. While the specific facts of the case will undoubtedly offer nuanced interpretations, the core reaffirmation is likely to be on the following lines:\n\n1.  **Burden of Proof Remains on the Claimant:** The Hon'ble Court has firmly reiterated that the onus to prove that the incidence of tax has *not* been passed on rests squarely with the applicant seeking the refund. This is not a task for the department to disprove; it's *your* responsibility to establish.\n2.  **Substance Over Form:** The judgment emphasizes that authorities must look beyond mere declarations and scrutinize the actual economic incidence of the tax. Are your books of accounts reflecting this? Have your pricing policies changed? These are the real questions the department will ask.\n3.  **Strengthening of Section 54(8) Interpretations:** The judgment is expected to provide definitive clarity on certain areas that have historically been ambiguous, particularly concerning what truly constitutes an exception under Section 54(8).\n\nThis reaffirmation reinforces the legislative intent: GST, being an indirect tax, presumes that the burden is eventually borne by the consumer. Any refund mechanism must safeguard against a situation where the taxpayer profits twice – once by collecting tax from customers and again by receiving a refund from the government.\n\n## Navigating the Exceptions: When the Principle Doesn't Apply\n\nWhile the general rule is to subject all refunds to the unjust enrichment test, Section 54(8) outlines specific scenarios where this principle does *not* apply. These are crucial for taxpayers to understand:\n\n*   **Exports:** Refunds of tax paid on **exports** of goods or services or both, or on inputs/input services used in making such exports, are typically exempt from the unjust enrichment test. It's important to note an amendment that shifted the language from \"zero-rated supplies\" to \"exports\" in Section 54(8)(a), effective February 1, 2019. This means the relief from unjust enrichment testing now specifically applies to exports, and suppliers to SEZ units might need to demonstrate that they have not passed on the tax burden.\n*   **Unutilized Input Tax Credit (ITC):**\n    *   Refund of unutilized ITC due to **zero-rated outward supplies** made without payment of tax.\n    *   Refund of unutilized ITC due to **inverted duty structure** (where the tax rate on inputs is higher than on output supplies).\n*   **Supply Not Provided:** Refunds of tax paid on a supply that was **not made**, either wholly or partially, and for which no invoice was issued, or where a refund voucher has been issued.\n*   **Wrong Tax Payment:** Refunds of tax wrongly paid to the Central Government or State Government.\n*   **Electronic Cash Ledger Balance:** This is a significant point. It has been clarified by High Courts and CBIC circulars that refunds from the **electronic cash ledger** are generally *not* subject to the unjust enrichment test, as these amounts represent the taxpayer's own money deposited with the government. This is a relief for many, *sahi baat hai*.\n*   **Pre-deposit in Appeals:** The refund of amounts pre-deposited during an appeal, if the appeal is decided in favor of the assessee, is also considered exempt from the unjust enrichment principle.\n\n## The Evidentiary Burden: Proof is Key\n\nFor refund claims where the principle of unjust enrichment *does* apply, the evidence you provide is paramount.\n\n*   **Claims up to ₹2 Lakhs:** A self-declaration affirming that the incidence of tax has not been passed on to another person is usually sufficient.\n*   **Claims exceeding ₹2 Lakhs:** Here's where the Chartered Accountant or Cost Accountant comes in. Rule 89(2) of the CGST Rules, 2017, mandates attaching a certificate in **Annexure 2 of Form GST RFD-01/RFD-02**, certifying that the incidence of tax and interest has not been passed on to any other person. This certificate isn't just a formality; it's a critical piece of evidence. The Supreme Court’s reaffirmation will undoubtedly increase the scrutiny on these certifications.\n\n## What Happens When Unjust Enrichment is Proven? The Consumer Welfare Fund\n\nIf the tax authorities determine that the incidence of tax has indeed been passed on, and the claim doesn't fall under any of the exceptions, the refund amount will not be granted to the applicant. Instead, it will be credited to the **Consumer Welfare Fund (CWF)**, as provided under **Section 57** of the CGST Act. This fund is a crucial mechanism to ensure that money collected from consumers, but erroneously or excess-paid, ultimately serves the consumer interest, rather than being an undue gain for the business.\n\n## Key Takeaways for Professionals\n\n1.  **Deep Dive into Records:** Always ensure your client's accounting records clearly demonstrate whether the tax burden was absorbed or passed on. Pricing policies, invoices, and ledger entries are your best friends here.\n2.  **Understand the Exceptions:** Be crystal clear on the specific scenarios listed under Section 54(8) where unjust enrichment doesn't apply. This knowledge can significantly streamline refund applications.\n3.  **The CA/CMA Certificate is Critical:** For claims over ₹2 Lakhs, the integrity and accuracy of the certificate are non-negotiable. This judgment likely reinforces the responsibility of the certifying professional.\n4.  **Stay Updated:** Tax laws are dynamic. While the core principle remains, judicial pronouncements fine-tune its application. Regular updates on rulings are *bahut zaroori*.\n\n## Conclusion: A Balancing Act for Fair Taxation\n\nThe Supreme Court's reaffirmation of the \"unjust enrichment\" principle is a testament to the judiciary's commitment to upholding fairness and equity in the tax system. It ensures that the GST refund mechanism serves its intended purpose – to return excess tax to the rightful claimant – without becoming a tool for undue gain. For tax professionals, this means a renewed emphasis on diligence, meticulous record-keeping, and a thorough understanding of the legal nuances surrounding this pivotal doctrine. It's all about striking that delicate balance between taxpayer rights and safeguarding public revenue.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Access Supreme Court of India Judgments here](https://www.sci.gov.in/judgments)\n\n*Published on: 26 February 2026*",
