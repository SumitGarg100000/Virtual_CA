The Central Government has dropped a significant bomb—or should I say, a very crucial notification—just as 2025 was drawing to a close. Dated December 31, 2025, a set of notifications has officially changed how we value tobacco and allied products for **Goods and Services Tax (GST)** purposes. This isn't just another amendment; it's a fundamental shift, now mandating **Retail Sale Price (RSP)** as the basis for GST valuation. So, what does this truly mean for manufacturers, distributors, and ultimately, our compliance strategies? Let's decode it.\n\nFor far too long, the valuation of certain high-revenue, often referred to as 'sin goods,' like tobacco and pan masala, has been a tricky wicket under GST. The standard transaction value mechanism, while robust for most goods, often faced challenges in these sectors, sometimes leading to disputes and potential revenue leakage. The government, through the recommendations of the GST Council, has now addressed this head-on.\n\n## The Big News: RSP-Based Valuation Arrives for Tobacco & Allied Products\n\nThe Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has ushered in this change through **Notification No. 19/2025–Central Tax** and **Notification No. 20/2025–Central Tax**, both dated December 31, 2025. These notifications are set to come into force from **February 1, 2026**.\n\nEssentially, a new **Rule 31D** has been inserted into the **Central Goods and Services Tax (Fifth Amendment) Rules, 2025**, which, read with amendments to **Notification No. 49/2023–Central Tax** (issued under Section 15(5) of the CGST Act, 2017), introduces a **deemed valuation mechanism based on Retail Sale Price (RSP)**. *Ab se, transaction value se zyada, RSP ka bolbala hoga!*\n\n## Why the Shift? Unpacking the Rationale Behind Rule 31D\n\nYou might be asking, *why this change now?* The intent is quite clear: to curb undervaluation, streamline tax collection, and ensure greater revenue stability in these traditionally complex sectors. The previous system, relying heavily on transaction value, sometimes left room for interpretation and potential manipulation, creating headaches for both taxpayers and tax administrators. This move aligns the GST valuation for these products more closely with the erstwhile excise duty regime, where MRP-based valuation was common, thereby simplifying compliance and making tax calculation more predictable.\n\n## The 'How': Deciphering New Rule 31D and Amended Notification 49/2023-CT\n\nLet's get into the nitty-gritty of how this new mechanism will operate.\n\n**Core Mechanism:** For specified goods, the **value of supply** will now be deemed to be the **declared Retail Sale Price (RSP)**, reduced by the amount of applicable GST. *Seedhi baat, no bakwaas!*\n\n**What is \"Retail Sale Price\" (RSP)?**\nThe notifications clearly define **\"retail sale price\"** as the maximum price declared on the goods in packaged form at which they may be sold to the ultimate consumer. Crucially, this price **includes all taxes, duties, surcharge, or cess**, by whatever name called.\n\n**Key Clarifications on RSP:**\nThe notifications also provide much-needed clarity on practical scenarios:\n*   **Multiple RSPs:** If more than one retail sale price is declared on a package, the **maximum of such retail sale prices** will be considered for valuation.\n*   **Altered RSPs:** If the declared RSP on a package is altered (increased) at any stage—before, during, or after the supply—then such **altered retail sale price** will be deemed to be the RSP. This prevents manufacturers from under-declaring RSP initially and increasing it later without proportionate tax payment.\n*   **Area-Specific RSPs:** Where different retail sale prices are declared on different packages for sale in different areas, each such RSP will be applicable for the goods intended to be sold in that specific area.\n\n**The Calculation Formula:**\nSince RSP is considered tax-inclusive, the GST payable will be computed using a reverse calculation. The formula is:\n**Tax Amount = (Retail Sale Price × applicable tax rate) ÷ (100 + sum of applicable tax rate)**\n\n**Which Goods Are Covered?**\nThis new valuation rule applies to specific goods, primarily:\n*   Pan Masala\n*   Unmanufactured tobacco (excluding tobacco leaves)\n*   Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos, and cigarettes\n*   Other manufactured tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes (excluding biris)\n*   Tobacco or nicotine products intended for inhalation without combustion.\n\n## Impact on the Supply Chain: The Rule 86B Exemption\n\nHere’s some relief for our downstream dealers! A corresponding amendment has been made to **Rule 86B** of the CGST Rules, 2017. This amendment provides that registered persons *other than manufacturers* will be exempted from the restrictions of Rule 86B, but only for the goods specified under Rule 31D. This exemption applies provided the tax on these goods has already been paid by the supplier (manufacturer) on an RSP basis. *Isse toh dealers ka compliance thoda easy ho jayega!*\n\nThis means if you're a wholesaler or retailer dealing in these products, and your supplier (the manufacturer) has already paid GST based on the RSP, you won't be subject to the electronic cash ledger payment restrictions under Rule 86B for these specific supplies. This is a practical step to ensure that the burden of tax payment is primarily fixed at the manufacturing stage based on RSP.\n\n## Old vs. New: A Quick Look\n\nLet's quickly compare how things were and how they will be:\n\n| Feature                   | Old Provision (Pre-Feb 1, 2026)                                  | New Provision (Effective Feb 1, 2026)                                                                                                    |\n| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Valuation Principle**   | Primarily transaction value under Section 15(1) of CGST Act.     | Deemed value based on **Retail Sale Price (RSP)** for specified goods, overriding transaction value.         |\n| **Governing Rule**        | Section 15 of CGST Act and Valuation Rules (Chapter IV of CGST Rules). | New **Rule 31D** inserted in CGST Rules, 2017, and amended **Notification No. 49/2023–Central Tax**.       |\n| **Treatment of RSP**      | Not a mandatory basis for GST valuation.                         | Becomes the mandatory and deemed basis for GST valuation, specifically defined as tax-inclusive.                 |\n| **Rule 86B Applicability**| General restrictions applied to all registered persons.            | Exemption from Rule 86B restrictions for non-manufacturers dealing in Rule 31D goods, provided tax paid on RSP by supplier. |\n\n## Broader Tax Landscape: A Word on Other Changes\n\nIt's important to remember that these valuation changes don't operate in isolation. They are part of a larger overhaul in the taxation of 'sin goods'. Simultaneously, the government has also notified the end of the **GST compensation cess** for tobacco products and pan masala, effective from February 1, 2026. Furthermore, new GST rates have been prescribed (e.g., 40% for most tobacco products, 18% for biris), along with the introduction of additional excise duty or a Health and National Security Cess on pan masala. These comprehensive reforms indicate a clear policy direction towards strengthening tax administration and revenue collection from these specific product categories.\n\n## Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal\n\nThis shift to RSP-based valuation for tobacco and allied products marks a significant move towards greater clarity, certainty, and potentially, enhanced revenue for the exchequer. For businesses involved in the manufacturing or distribution of these specified goods, a thorough review of their pricing, accounting, and GST compliance processes is paramount. *Yeh change halka mat lena, boss!* Ensure your systems are updated to accurately capture and report GST based on the declared Retail Sale Price, keeping in mind all the new definitions and clarifications. Proactive adaptation will be key to smooth sailing in this new tax regime.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.cbic.gov.in/)\n\n*Published on: 5 January 2026*",
