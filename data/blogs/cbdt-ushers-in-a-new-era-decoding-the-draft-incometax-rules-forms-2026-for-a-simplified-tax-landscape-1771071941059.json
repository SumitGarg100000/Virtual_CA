This isn't just another routine update, *yaar*. This is a foundational overhaul, signaling a strategic shift in India's direct tax administration, designed to operationalize the much-anticipated **Income-tax Act, 2025**, which is set to come into force from April 1, 2026. The existing six-decade-old Income-tax Rules, 1962, are finally paving the way for a leaner, clearer, and more contemporary framework.\n\nAs professionals, we often grapple with the complexities, ambiguities, and sheer volume of compliance requirements. The constant juggling between multiple rules and forms, and the inherent potential for litigation, can be quite taxing, *hai na*? Well, the CBDT's latest move aims to address precisely these pain points.\n\n### The Big Picture: Why This Overhaul Matters\n\nThe core philosophy behind these draft rules is elegantly simple: **simplify, streamline, and digitize**. The CBDT's stated objectives are clear: to simplify statutory language, reduce litigation and interpretational disputes, lower the overall compliance burden on taxpayers, and identify and eliminate redundant or obsolete rules and forms. The new framework seeks to leverage technology for automated reconciliation and pre-filled data, widening the tax base and promoting ease of doing business across the board.\n\nAnd the numbers speak for themselves! The sheer volume of regulations has seen a remarkable reduction:\n*   The number of **rules** has been cut down from 511 to a more manageable **333**.\n*   Similarly, the **forms** have been drastically reduced from 399 to just **190**.\n\nThis significant consolidation is a welcome step, promising a much more streamlined and navigable tax environment for us and our clients.\n\n### Key Changes and Their Implications: A Deep Dive\n\nLet's zoom in on some of the critical changes proposed in these draft rules:\n\n#### 1. Rationalisation of Perquisite Thresholds\n\nThis is a long-awaited move! The archaic perquisite thresholds, which had become irrelevant with inflation and changing economic realities, have finally been rationalised. For instance, the values for tax-free at-work meals and certain allowances have been updated.\n\n| Item                 | Old Provision (Income-tax Rules, 1962) | New Provision (Draft Income-tax Rules, 2026) |\n| :------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |\n| Children Education   | ₹100 /month per child                  | ₹3,000 /month per child            |\n| Hostel Allowance     | ₹300 /month per child                  | ₹9,000 /month per child            |\n| Free Meals           | ₹50 per meal                           | ₹200 per meal                      |\n\nThis adjustment brings these exemptions closer to contemporary economic realities, making them more meaningful for employees.\n\n#### 2. Redefining 'Accountant' for Certification Purposes\n\nA significant change impacting our profession is the revised definition of an **'accountant'** for certification purposes under the new law. Under the draft rules:\n*   **Individual professionals** will now need a minimum of **10 years of experience** and **annual receipts exceeding Rs 50 lakh** in the year preceding certification.\n*   **Partners in firms** engaged in accountancy or valuation services will qualify only if the entity's **annual receipts exceed Rs 3 crore**.\n\nThis move seems to be aimed at ensuring a higher standard of experience and capacity for professionals undertaking specific certifications.\n\n#### 3. Simplified and Standardised ITR Forms\n\nThe new rules introduce redesigned tax return and compliance forms. The goal is to standardise common information, reduce the compliance burden, and enable automated reconciliation and pre-filled data. The forms will now be identified by serial numbers (1-190) instead of the existing alphanumeric nomenclature.\n\nCrucially, the eligibility conditions for ITR-1 to ITR-7 have been made much sharper. For example:\n*   **ITR-1 (Sahaj)** remains for resident individuals with straightforward income (salary, one property, interest).\n*   However, taxpayers with complexities like multiple house properties or foreign income will be pushed to other forms.\n*   **ITR-4 (Sugam)** will no longer be a 'one-size-fits-all' shortcut. It will explicitly bar taxpayers with foreign assets/income, company directorships, unlisted equity shares, income over ₹50 lakh, more than two house properties, carried-forward losses, or agricultural income exceeding ₹5,000. Many small business owners and professionals previously using ITR-4 might now find themselves needing to file ITR-3.\n\nMoreover, electronic filing is now mandated for most taxpayers, with paper returns permitted only for super senior citizens aged 80 or above. This is a clear push towards a digital-first tax administration.\n\n#### 4. Clarifications Across Various Provisions\n\nThe draft rules also provide much-needed clarity on several critical areas, including:\n*   **Dividend distribution** and the recognition of stock exchanges.\n*   The method for determining the **period of holding of capital assets** in certain cases, along with updated provisions for the **fair market valuation** of shares and other assets like jewellery and property.\n*   Guidelines for the notification and issuance of **zero-coupon bonds**.\n*   Provisions related to **significant economic presence** in the digital economy.\n*   Clearer taxation norms for various **employee benefits and medical facilities**.\n*   The audit report in **draft Form No. 26** for Section 63 of the Income-tax Act, 2025, specifically provides for **ICDS adjustments**. This is particularly noteworthy, especially if the Union Budget 2026's proposal to merge ICDS with Ind-AS and scrap separate tax accounting requirements from tax year 2027-28 materializes; this form might require a further overhaul then.\n\nFor charitable trusts, political parties, and other exempt institutions filing **ITR-7**, the draft rules introduce heightened scrutiny and tighter linkages between audit reports, donation disclosures, and fund utilisation.\n\n### Your Voice Matters: The Feedback Mechanism\n\nThe CBDT has explicitly invited comments and suggestions from all stakeholders – taxpayers, tax professionals, industry bodies, and the public – to refine these draft rules and forms. This is a participatory approach to rulemaking, *bhai*! The feedback period is open for 15 days, **until February 22, 2026**.\n\nYou can submit your inputs through a dedicated utility launched on the official Income Tax e-filing portal. The suggestions are encouraged rule-wise and form-wise, focusing on four key areas:\n1.  **Simplification of Language**\n2.  **Reduction of Litigation**\n3.  **Reduction of Compliance Burden**\n4.  **Identification of Redundant/Obsolete Rules and Forms**\n\nThis is our chance to contribute meaningfully to the final shape of India's direct tax framework.\n\n### Conclusion: A Step Towards Progressive Tax Governance\n\nThe release of the Draft Income-tax Rules & Forms, 2026, marks a pivotal moment in India's journey towards a more modern, efficient, and taxpayer-friendly direct tax regime. While the Income-tax Act, 2025, sets the legislative intent, these rules provide the operational blueprint. It’s important to remember that these new rules, aligned with the Income-tax Act, 2025, will apply for **Financial Year 2026-27 (Assessment Year 2027-28)** onwards. For the upcoming filing season, i.e., Assessment Year 2026-27 (for FY 2025-26), the existing provisions under the Income Tax Act, 1961, will continue to apply.\n\nAs tax professionals, it's incumbent upon us to thoroughly review these drafts, understand their implications, and actively participate in the feedback process. Our collective insights can help ensure that the final rules are robust, practical, and truly simplify compliance for everyone. This move towards a consolidated, clear, and technology-driven tax administration is a significant step forward, promising greater transparency and ease of doing business in India.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Press Release here](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1999909)\n\n*Published on: 14 February 2026*",
