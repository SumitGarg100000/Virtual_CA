Many of us have felt the heat as show cause notices and assessment orders for older financial years kept landing, often citing extensions through various CBIC notifications. Well, a significant judgment from the Madras High Court might just change the game. On December 20, 2025, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court delivered a powerful blow, declaring several CBIC notifications extending the time limits for GST adjudication as **ultra vires** – meaning, beyond the powers of the issuing authority. This is a monumental decision, something that demands our immediate attention and analysis.\n\n### The Genesis of the Problem: Extending the 'Lakshman Rekha'\n\nFor any tax professional, the concept of **limitation periods** is sacrosanct. It's that definitive 'lakshman rekha' that both taxpayers and tax authorities must respect. Under the **CGST Act, 2017**, specific time limits are prescribed for the issuance of show cause notices (SCNs) and the passing of adjudication orders, primarily under **Section 73** (for cases not involving fraud, wilful misstatement, or suppression of facts) and **Section 74** (for cases involving these elements).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly brought unprecedented challenges. To address these disruptions, **Section 168A** was introduced into the CGST Act, allowing the government to extend timelines for various actions in cases of **force majeure**. This seemed like a reasonable step. However, the subsequent notifications issued by the CBIC, particularly **Notification No. 09/2023-Central Tax dated March 31, 2023**, and **Notification No. 56/2023-Central Tax dated December 28, 2023**, pushed these extensions further, purportedly for financial years 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20. It felt like an endless loop for many, creating uncertainty and extending tax liabilities indefinitely.\n\n### The Petitioner's Stance and the Court's Scrutiny\n\nThe legality of these extensions came under sharp focus in various writ petitions before the Madras High Court. In the recent case of **Tvl. Voylla Fashions Private Limited**, among others, taxpayers challenged the validity of these CBIC notifications. The core argument was simple yet profound: Did the CBIC truly have the power to extend these time limits to such an extent, or had it exceeded its delegated legislative authority?\n\nThe petitioners contended that:\n*   The extensions went beyond the scope of **Section 168A** of the CGST Act.\n*   The notifications were arbitrary and legally unsustainable.\n*   There was a lack of a direct causal link between the COVID-19 pandemic (the cited force majeure event) and the administrative delays that necessitated these repeated extensions. In many instances, the delays were attributed to systemic deficiencies and staff shortages, not the pandemic itself.\n*   A critical procedural flaw existed: the mandatory prior recommendation of the **GST Council**, as stipulated under Section 168A, was often missing or replaced by recommendations from the GST Implementation Committee (GIC) or simply a post-facto approval. This, the petitioners argued, rendered the notifications procedurally invalid.\n*   The notifications seemed to disregard or attempt to curtail the broader exclusion of limitation periods granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court through its *suo motu* orders under **Article 142** of the Constitution, which had excluded the period from March 15, 2020, to February 28, 2022, for *all* judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.\n\n### The Court's Magnifying Glass: A Deep Dive into the Reasoning\n\nThe Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, following its own precedents and the rulings of coordinate benches, meticulously examined the statutory framework and the impugned notifications. The judgment dated December 20, 2025, in the case of Tvl. Voylla Fashions Private Limited, unequivocally affirmed that the CBIC had indeed exceeded its statutory powers.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the Court’s key findings:\n\n1.  **Ultra Vires to Section 168A**: The Court held that the notifications were **ultra vires Section 168A** of the CGST Act. Section 168A is a specific provision that grants power to extend time limits under *exceptional circumstances* of force majeure. The Court emphasized that this power cannot be used to grant blanket extensions indiscriminately.\n2.  **Lack of Causal Link to Force Majeure**: A force majeure event like COVID-19 must be the *proximate cause* for the inability to act within the prescribed limitation. The Court observed that administrative inefficiencies, staff shortages, or systemic issues within the department cannot be conflated with a genuine force majeure event to justify extensions.\n3.  **Mandatory GST Council Recommendation**: The requirement of a prior recommendation from the **GST Council** before issuing such notifications under Section 168A is a **jurisdictional precondition**, not a mere formality. The Court found that **Notification No. 56/2023**, for instance, was issued based on the recommendations of the GST Implementation Committee (GIC), which cannot substitute the constitutional role of the GST Council. A post-facto approval by the Council is not a valid compliance with the law.\n4.  **Supremacy of Supreme Court's Orders**: The Court noted that the Supreme Court's *suo motu* orders under Article 142 had already provided for the exclusion of a specific period for limitation. The CBIC notifications, by attempting to rework or curtail this already extended timeline, were found to be unsustainable and in conflict with the higher judicial directive.\n\nConsequently, the Court quashed both **Notification No. 09/2023-Central Tax** and **Notification No. 56/2023-Central Tax** as illegal and set aside consequential assessment orders that relied on these invalid extensions.\n\n### What This Means for You: The Ground Reality Shifts\n\nThis judgment carries profound implications for both taxpayers and tax authorities:\n\n*   **Invalidation of Notices and Orders**: Show cause notices and adjudication orders issued under the invalidated extended periods, particularly for FY 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20, may now be rendered **time-barred** and potentially invalid.\n*   **Relief for Taxpayers**: Taxpayers who have received such SCNs or against whom assessment orders have been passed relying on these extensions now have a strong legal ground to challenge them. If you have appeals pending, this judgment provides a robust argument.\n*   **Department's Dilemma**: The tax department now faces the challenge of revisiting numerous pending assessments and demands that were based on these extended timelines. This could lead to a significant number of demands being quashed.\n*   **Strict Interpretation of Delegated Powers**: This ruling serves as a crucial reminder that delegated legislation must strictly adhere to the parent Act and constitutional provisions. Government bodies cannot overstep their statutory mandates.\n\nIt’s a sigh of relief for many, a bit like saying, \"Ab yeh rule applicable nahi hai!\" (This rule is no longer applicable).\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThe Madras High Court's judgment on December 20, 2025, is a landmark decision reaffirming the sanctity of limitation periods and the limits of delegated legislation under GST. It brings much-needed clarity and relief to the taxpayer community, challenging the unfettered exercise of power in extending deadlines. While the department may explore appeals, for now, this judgment provides a powerful tool for taxpayers to defend against time-barred proceedings. It's imperative for every professional dealing with GST to understand the nuances of this ruling and its potential impact on their cases.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Visit the Madras High Court official website](https://www.hcmadras.tn.nic.in/)\n\n*Published on: 23 December 2025*",
