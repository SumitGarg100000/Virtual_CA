One such friction point has been the interplay between the **Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 (as amended by the 2016 Act)** and the **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC)**. For liquidators, Resolution Professionals, and legal advisors, the question of whether assets identified as 'benami' during insolvency proceedings could be protected under the IBC was a grey area, often leading to protracted litigation.\n\nWell, the Supreme Court has now delivered a much-awaited clarification, firmly drawing a line in the sand. In a significant judgment dated February 24, 2026, the Apex Court has unequivocally held that insolvency tribunals, i.e., the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), have **no jurisdiction** to interfere with the confiscation of property under the Benami Act. *Yeh rule ab bilkul clear hai!*\n\n## The Conundrum: Benami Action vs. IBC Moratorium\n\nImagine a corporate debtor undergoing insolvency or liquidation. Assets are being identified and collated to maximize value for creditors. Suddenly, authorities under the Benami Act step in, alleging that certain properties held by the corporate debtor are, in fact, 'benami' and issue provisional attachment orders. The liquidator, naturally, would want these assets to be part of the liquidation estate to satisfy creditor claims, often invoking the IBC's moratorium provisions. This is precisely the scenario that led to the recent Supreme Court pronouncement.\n\nIn a batch of appeals, notably in the lead case of **S. Rajendran v. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (Benami Prohibition) and ors.**, liquidators had challenged provisional attachment orders under the Benami Act before the NCLT, seeking to have these assets treated as part of the liquidation estate. The NCLT and NCLAT had consistently declined jurisdiction, and the matter reached the Supreme Court.\n\n## Understanding the Legal Provisions at Play\n\nTo appreciate the Court's rationale, let's quickly recap the relevant provisions:\n\n*   **The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016:** This Act significantly strengthened the original 1988 Act, providing a robust framework for identifying, attaching, adjudicating, and ultimately confiscating benami properties. Once an Adjudicating Authority confirms a provisional attachment, the property vests absolutely in the Central Government under **Section 27** of the Benami Act.\n*   **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC):** The IBC aims for time-bound resolution of insolvency and maximization of asset value for creditors. **Section 14** imposes a moratorium on various actions against the corporate debtor and its assets once the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) commences. **Section 36** defines the 'liquidation estate' of the corporate debtor, which includes all assets belonging to the debtor. **Section 60(5)** grants NCLT wide powers to entertain applications or proceedings by or against the corporate debtor.\n\nThe core argument of the liquidators was often that the **Section 14 moratorium** should halt Benami proceedings and that these assets should be part of the **liquidation estate** under IBC.\n\n## The Supreme Court's Resounding Verdict\n\nA Bench comprising Justices Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Atul S. Chandurkar dismissed the appeals, delivering a clear message: The Benami Act holds the fort when it comes to tainted properties.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Court's key findings:\n\n*   **Benami Act: A Self-Contained Code:** The Supreme Court emphasized that the Benami Act is a **self-contained code** with its own comprehensive adjudicatory and appellate framework. This means that any challenge to an attachment or confiscation order passed under the Benami Act must be pursued *only* through the mechanisms provided within that Act itself.\n*   **Sovereign Action vs. Creditor Action:** The Court drew a sharp distinction between the nature of proceedings under the two laws. Actions under the Benami Act, particularly those leading to attachment and confiscation, are **sovereign actions in rem**. They operate in the public law domain, aimed at identifying and confiscating \"tainted property\" that was never legitimately owned by the purported holder. In contrast, the IBC primarily deals with *private law disputes* concerning the insolvency resolution of legitimate assets of a corporate debtor for the benefit of creditors.\n*   **No Beneficial Interest, No Liquidation Estate:** Crucially, the Court clarified that property determined to be 'benami' is held without any beneficial interest by the 'benamidar'. Once such property is provisionally attached and confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority under the Benami Act, it **vests absolutely in the Central Government under Section 27**. Consequently, such property falls outside the definition of the 'liquidation estate' under Section 36 of the IBC. *Matlab, jo aapka hai hi nahi, woh insolvency estate ka hissa kaise banega?*\n*   **Moratorium Inapplicable to Sovereign Acts:** The **Section 14 moratorium** under the IBC is intended to protect the corporate debtor's assets from creditor recovery actions. It does *not* extend to or operate against sovereign confiscatory actions undertaken by the government under penal statutes like the Benami Act.\n*   **NCLT Not a Review Forum for Sovereign Actions:** Allowing the NCLT to examine the correctness of Benami Act attachments would amount to elevating it to a judicial review forum over sovereign actions. The Court categorically stated that the IBC does not provide an indirect route to challenge sovereign acts validly undertaken under a penal statute.\n*   **Abuse of Process and Costs:** The Supreme Court did not mince words, finding that the liquidators' appeals were an abuse of the legal process, intended to circumvent the procedures contemplated under the Benami Act. Accordingly, it imposed exemplary costs of ₹5 lakhs on each of the petitioners, to be deposited with the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association.\n\n## What Does This Mean for Professionals?\n\nThis judgment brings much-needed clarity, but also highlights critical considerations for CAs, legal analysts, and liquidators:\n\n*   **Clear Jurisdictional Demarcation:** The lines are now sharply drawn. If a property is under scrutiny or attached under the Benami Act, the challenge mechanism lies *solely* within the Benami Act's framework. Do not expect relief from the NCLT or NCLAT.\n*   **Early Identification is Key:** For Resolution Professionals and liquidators, this ruling underscores the importance of conducting thorough due diligence to identify potential 'benami' tainted assets early in the insolvency process. Such assets, if identified and actioned upon by Benami authorities, cannot be factored into the liquidation estate for creditor distribution.\n*   **Risk for Creditors:** While the IBC aims for maximization of value, assets declared benami and confiscated will not be available for distribution to creditors. This can significantly impact creditor recovery in cases where the corporate debtor held substantial benami properties.\n*   **Reinforced Enforcement:** This decision significantly strengthens the hand of authorities enforcing the Benami Act, ensuring that insolvency proceedings are not used as a shield to protect illegally acquired properties. It reiterates the government's strong stance against black money and illicit transactions.\n*   **Retrospectivity - A Separate Discussion:** While this judgment focuses on the jurisdictional conflict, it's important to remember that the broader issue of the retrospective application of the Benami Act's penal provisions (especially concerning transactions prior to the 2016 amendment) has been a subject of separate Supreme Court pronouncements, like the *Ganpati Dealcom* case, which indicated prospective application for penal and forfeiture provisions. However, the current judgment is specific to the *interplay of confiscation under Benami Act and IBC*.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis ruling by Justices Narasimha and Chandurkar is a pivotal development. It sends a strong message: **sovereign action against benami property will take precedence, and the IBC cannot be used as an indirect route to derail such proceedings.** For professionals, it means adapting strategies and ensuring compliance from day one. *Benami transactions ki game mein, ab rules aur bhi pakke ho gaye hain!*\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://main.sci.gov.in/)\n\n*Published on: 27 February 2026*",
