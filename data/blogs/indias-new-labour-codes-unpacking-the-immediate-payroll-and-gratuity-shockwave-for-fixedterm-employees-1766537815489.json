The Indian labour landscape has witnessed a monumental shift, and by now, we're all feeling the ripples, especially since the four new Labour Codes – the **Code on Wages, 2019**, the **Industrial Relations Code, 2020**, the **Code on Social Security, 2020**, and the **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020** – officially came into effect on November 21, 2025. This isn't just a regulatory update; it's a complete overhaul, streamlining 29 erstwhile central labour laws into a modern, consolidated framework.\n\nAs Chartered Accountants and Legal Analysts, our immediate focus turns to the nitty-gritty of compliance, particularly the profound impact on **payroll** and **gratuity** for our **fixed-term employees (FTEs)**. The changes are significant, demanding a prompt revisit of compensation structures, HR policies, and compliance mechanisms.\n\n## The Game-Changer: Gratuity for Fixed-Term Employees\n\nFor years, gratuity was largely seen as a reward for long-term loyalty, primarily kicking in after five years of continuous service. This perception and the underlying legal framework have now been fundamentally altered, especially for FTEs.\n\n### Old Provision vs. New Provision: Gratuity Eligibility\n\nLet's break down the most impactful change with a quick comparison:\n\n| Old Provision (Under Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972) | New Provision (Under Code on Social Security, 2020) |\n| :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |\n| Fixed-term employees typically eligible for gratuity only after **5 years** of continuous service. | Fixed-term employees are now eligible for gratuity after completing just **1 year** of continuous service. |\n| Termination before 5 years often meant no gratuity for FTEs. | Gratuity is payable on a **pro-rata basis** upon termination of the contract period, provided one year of continuous service is completed. |\n\nThis is a monumental shift. The **Code on Social Security, 2020**, specifically under Section 53, has reduced the eligibility requirement for gratuity for FTEs from five years to one year. The intent here is clear: to bring FTEs on par with permanent workers in terms of social security benefits, ensuring they are not disadvantaged simply because their employment is for a specific duration.\n\n### How Gratuity Will Be Calculated\n\nWhile the eligibility period has changed, the core calculation methodology for gratuity largely remains the same – 15 days' wages for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months. However, the impact on the \"wages\" component is where payroll teams need to pay close attention.\n\n## The Payroll Conundrum: Redefining \"Wages\"\n\nBeyond gratuity eligibility, the new Labour Codes introduce a revised and uniform definition of **\"wages\"** across all legislations, notably under the Code on Wages, 2019. This redefinition has direct implications for payroll structures and statutory contributions.\n\n### The 50% Wage Rule\n\nOne of the most talked-about provisions is the mandate that **at least 50% of an employee's total remuneration (Cost-to-Company or CTC) must constitute \"wages.\"** What does this mean in practical terms? It implies that the sum of components like Basic Pay, Dearness Allowance, and other elements explicitly defined as \"wages\" must make up at least half of the gross salary. If the non-wage components (like HRA, conveyance allowance, etc., which are usually excluded for provident fund and gratuity calculations) exceed 50% of the total remuneration, the excess amount will be *deemed* as wages for the purpose of calculating statutory benefits.\n\nThis revised definition of wages will directly impact the calculation of:\n*   **Gratuity:** A higher \"wage\" component will naturally lead to higher gratuity payouts.\n*   **Provident Fund (PF):** Employer and employee contributions will be based on this higher wage threshold.\n*   **Bonus:** The calculation of bonus, where applicable, will also be affected.\n\n### Parity in Benefits for FTEs\n\nAnother crucial aspect for payroll is the explicit provision that fixed-term employees are now entitled to the same salary, allowances, and other benefits as permanent employees performing similar work, on a pro-rata basis. This includes not just gratuity, but also Employees' State Insurance (ESI), Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), and bonus, proportionate to their tenure. This ensures fair treatment and removes any ambiguities that might have existed in the past.\n\n## Immediate Compliance Actions for Employers\n\nWith the codes now in effect, procrastination is not an option. Here's what companies need to tackle immediately:\n\n*   **Review and Restructure Compensation Packages:** Analyze your existing CTC structures for all employees, especially FTEs. Ensure that the \"wages\" component complies with the 50% rule under the Code on Wages, 2019. This might necessitate re-designing salary components for many employees to align with the new definition.\n*   **Re-evaluate Gratuity Liabilities:** With the reduced eligibility period for FTEs and the revised wage definition, your gratuity liabilities are likely to see a substantial increase – estimates suggest a 25-50% jump for many Indian companies. Actuarial valuations must be updated to reflect these new obligations.\n*   **Update Payroll Systems and Processes:** Your payroll software and internal processes must be updated to accurately calculate gratuity, PF, and other statutory benefits based on the new wage definition and eligibility criteria for FTEs. This also includes ensuring timely payment of gratuity within 30 days of an employee's exit, as delays can attract penalties.\n*   **Revise Employment Contracts:** All fixed-term employment contracts need to be reviewed and revised to reflect the new entitlements and conditions mandated by the Codes. This ensures legal compliance and clarity for both employers and employees.\n*   **Communicate Changes Effectively:** It's essential to transparently communicate these changes to your workforce, particularly to FTEs, explaining their enhanced benefits and how their payroll components might be adjusted.\n\n## Final Thoughts: Navigating the New Normal\n\nThe new Labour Codes are a monumental step towards formalizing employment, enhancing social security, and ensuring fair wages across India's diverse workforce. While the transition may involve initial complexities and increased compliance burdens, especially for payroll and HR teams, the long-term benefits of a more equitable and transparent labour ecosystem are undeniable.\n\nEmbrace these changes proactively. See this as an opportunity to strengthen your organization's commitment to employee welfare and robust compliance. Remember, in this evolving landscape, being informed and agile is not just good practice, it's essential for sustainable business operations. *Yeh naya norm hai, aur humein iske saath chalna hai.*\n\n---\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2015886)\n\n*Published on: 24 December 2025*",
