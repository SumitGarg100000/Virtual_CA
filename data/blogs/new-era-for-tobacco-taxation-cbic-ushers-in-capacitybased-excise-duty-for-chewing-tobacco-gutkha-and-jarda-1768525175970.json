The latest move from the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is a prime example. While we might have been looking for a specific notification dated January 6, 2026, the foundational changes that have set the stage for a new taxation regime in the chewing tobacco, gutkha, and jarda sector were actually laid down through a series of significant notifications issued on **December 31, 2025**. These new rules, collectively known as the **Chewing Tobacco, Jarda Scented Tobacco and Gutkha Packing Machines (Capacity Determination and Collection of Duty) Rules, 2026**, are set to kick in from **February 1, 2026**. This isn't just another amendment; it’s a re-imagination of how excise duty will be levied and collected in this high-stakes segment.\n\nSo, what's the big deal? Let's dive deep into this pivotal policy shift.\n\n## The 'Why' Behind the Shift: Curbing Evasion and Bolstering Revenue\n\nFor years, the tobacco sector, particularly chewing tobacco, jarda, and gutkha, has presented significant challenges in tax administration due to widespread tax evasion. The previous ad valorem or RSP (Retail Sale Price) based valuation methods, despite their intent, often fell prey to under-declaration of production or manipulation of sales data. The government has been consistently exploring mechanisms to create a more robust and transparent taxation framework.\n\nThis reintroduction of a capacity-based levy under **Section 3A of the Central Excise Act, 1944**, is a direct response to these perennial issues. It signals the government's firm resolve to shift the tax incidence from actual production or transactional value to a deemed production capacity, primarily linked to the operational capabilities of packing machines. This strategy aims to ensure predictable revenue collection and significantly reduce the scope for evasion. Moreover, this move comes at a crucial time, coinciding with the cessation of the GST compensation cess, necessitating alternative robust revenue streams for these products which continue to attract Central Excise Duty in addition to GST and National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD).\n\n## Decoding the New Rules: What's Changed?\n\nThe core of this new regime is encapsulated in several notifications, all dated December 31, 2025, and effective from February 1, 2026:\n\n*   **Notification No. 03/2025–Central Excise (N.T.)**: This notification formally brings the Central Excise (Amendment) Act, 2025 into force, providing the legal backbone for these changes.\n*   **Notification No. 04/2025–Central Excise (N.T.)**: This is a crucial one. It specifies chewing tobacco (including filter khaini), jarda scented tobacco, and gutkha manufactured using packing machines and packed in pouches, as \"notified goods\" under Section 3A of the Central Excise Act, 1944. This means these specific products will now be subject to the capacity-based levy.\n*   **Notification No. 05/2025–Central Excise (N.T.)**: This notification introduces the **Chewing Tobacco, Jarda Scented Tobacco and Gutkha Packing Machines (Capacity Determination and Collection of Duty) Rules, 2026**. These rules meticulously detail how the production capacity will be determined and how duty will be collected.\n*   **Notification No. 04/2025–Central Excise**: This notification prescribes the actual monthly excise duty rates per packing machine, a key component for calculating the duty payable.\n*   **Notification No. 03/2025–Central Excise**: This notification revises the overall central excise duty structure for tobacco and tobacco-related products.\n\n### Key Provisions of the Capacity-Based Levy Rules (Rules, 2026):\n\nLet's break down the salient features of the Chewing Tobacco, Jarda Scented Tobacco and Gutkha Packing Machines (Capacity Determination and Collection of Duty) Rules, 2026:\n\n*   **Notified Goods Defined**: The rules clearly define \"chewing tobacco\" (including filter khaini), \"jarda scented tobacco,\" and \"gutkha\" as the goods falling under this new regime when manufactured with the aid of packing machines and packed in pouches.\n*   **\"Packing Machine\" Broadly Defined**: To pre-empt any loopholes, the definition of \"packing machine\" is expansive. It includes all types of Form-Fill-Seal (FFS) machines (vertical or horizontal, single-track or multi-track) and any other machine used for packing pouches of the notified goods. This ensures that any machinery used for pouch packing falls under the ambit.\n*   **Capacity Determination**: The determination of annual production capacity will be based on multiplying the deemed monthly production by twelve. The monthly duty will be calculated by applying the notified rate (from Notification No. 04/2025-Central Excise) to factors like the number of machines, their tracks, rated speed, and the Retail Sale Price (RSP) slabs.\n*   **Mandatory Declarations**: Manufacturers are now required to file a detailed declaration in **FORM CE DEC-01** on the CBIC portal by **February 7, 2026**, or within seven days of commencing manufacturing. This declaration needs to include all technical specifications and details of the packing machines. A **Chartered Engineer's Certificate in Form CE CCE-01** is also mandated. This is a critical compliance step, bhai.\n*   **Advance Duty Payment**: The duty liability for an entire month must be paid in advance by the 6th day of that month. For new manufacturers, the first month's duty is calculated on a pro-rata basis and payable within five days of machine installation.\n*   **Strict Surveillance (CCTV)**: This is a game-changer. Manufacturers are now required to install and maintain functional CCTV systems covering all packing areas. The footage needs to be preserved for at least 48 months (some sources say 24 months, so 48 is the safer assumption). This stringent monitoring aims to bring absolute transparency to production activities.\n*   **Abatement Provisions**: There are provisions for abatement of duty if a machine remains sealed and non-operational for fifteen days or more, provided the jurisdictional Central Excise officer is intimated three working days in advance.\n*   **No Rebate on Export**: Interestingly, no rebate of excise duty will be granted on notified goods on which duty has been paid under Section 3A, and no material can be removed for export without duty payment. CENVAT credit, however, is admissible on notified goods in bulk packs.\n*   **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Strict penalties, confiscation of goods, and deemed operation presumptions are in place for non-registration, under-declaration, non-declaration or tampering with RSP, and other non-compliances. If unregistered machines are found, duty liability can be determined assuming operation from February 1, 2026, or the last five years, whichever is later. Yeh thodi sakhti toh zaroori hai.\n\n### The Financial Impact: Higher Duty Rates\n\nAlong with the procedural changes, the government has also significantly revised the effective central excise duty rates. For instance, Gutkha will now attract excise duty at 91%, while chewing tobacco and jarda scented tobacco will be taxed at 82%. This is a substantial increase compared to the previous rates. These duties are *over and above* the 40% GST (for pan masala, tobacco, and cigarettes) and the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD). For a ₹1 pouch, the GST component alone will be around 28.57% of the RSP.\n\n## Old vs. New: A Quick Look\n\n| Feature                  | Old Provision (Pre-Feb 1, 2026)                                | New Provision (Effective Feb 1, 2026)                                                                                             |\n| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Basis of Levy**        | Primarily ad valorem or RSP-based (based on actual clearance)  | **Capacity-based** levy under Section 3A of Central Excise Act, 1944 (deemed production based on machine capacity)                                              |\n| **Trigger Event**        | Clearance from factory                                         | Deemed production based on installed packing machine capacity                                                                                                       |\n| **Key Determinants**     | Declared production/sales value, Retail Sale Price (RSP)       | Number of packing machines, their tracks, rated speed, RSP slabs, and other notified factors                                                                        |\n| **Compliance Focus**     | Record-keeping for actual production/sales                     | **Mandatory declarations** (CE DEC-01, CE CCE-01), **advance monthly duty payment**, stringent **CCTV surveillance** of packing areas for 48 months              |\n| **Duty Payment Cycle**   | Typically monthly, post-production                             | **Advance monthly payment** by the 6th of the month (pro-rata for new installations)                                                                                |\n| **Anti-Evasion Measure** | Audits, physical verification, intelligence-based operations   | Automated capacity-based assessment, continuous **CCTV monitoring**, penalties for undeclared machines or tampering, deemed operation for unregistered machines |\n| **Export Benefits**      | Rebate of duty and export without duty payment generally allowed | No rebate on duty paid under Section 3A, no export without duty payment for notified goods                                                                          |\n| **Impact on Rates**      | Varies, but generally lower excise duty component              | Significantly higher excise duty rates (e.g., Gutkha 91%, Chewing Tobacco/Jarda 82%)                                                                                |\n\n## Final Thoughts: A Paradigm Shift for Manufacturers\n\nThis shift to a capacity-based excise duty regime is a clear signal from the government: tax evasion in the tobacco sector will be met with stringent measures. For manufacturers of chewing tobacco, gutkha, and jarda, this is nothing short of a paradigm shift. The focus is now less on what you *say* you produce and more on what your machines *can* produce.\n\nThe onus is squarely on the manufacturers to ensure meticulous compliance with the new declaration requirements, maintain transparent records, and strictly adhere to the CCTV surveillance mandates. Any laxity here could lead to significant financial repercussions, including heavy penalties and retrospective duty demands.\n\nWhile the aim is to simplify compliance for tax authorities and ensure stable revenue, for businesses, this means recalibrating their production planning, tax outflow management, and overall operational strategies. It's time to get your house in order, because yeh naya rule ab aapke packing machines par seedhe asar dalega!\n\n## Read the Official Document\n\n*   [Download the Official Notifications/Circulars here (FAQs by PIB which reference the notifications)](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2079053)\n\n*Published on: 16 January 2026*",
