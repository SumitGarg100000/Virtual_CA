We've just received a significant update from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) that's sure to keep us busy for the next couple of weeks – the much-anticipated **Draft Income-tax Rules, 2026**, have been released for public feedback. Published on February 7, 2026, these aren't just minor tweaks; we're looking at a comprehensive overhaul designed to align with the new **Income-tax Act, 2025**, which, as we know, kicks in from April 1, 2026.\n\nNow, as seasoned professionals, we understand that tax laws are not just about numbers; they're about interpretation, compliance, and ultimately, easing the burden on taxpayers. The CBDT's move to invite public comments on these draft rules is a welcome step towards making the legislative process more participative and effective. So, *chalo*, let's decode what these new rules bring to the table and what it means for us and our clients.\n\n## The Big Picture: Simplifying, Streamlining, and Modernizing\n\nThe core philosophy behind these draft rules is simplification and reduction of compliance complexity. We've all grappled with the voluminous **Income-tax Rules, 1962**, which, with its 511 rules and 399 forms, sometimes felt like navigating a *bhool bhulaiya*. The new draft aims to drastically cut this down to approximately **333 rules and 190 forms**. This isn't just about reducing quantity; it's about eliminating redundancy, consolidating provisions, and simplifying the language for better comprehension. *Yeh toh acchi baat hai na?*\n\nThe rules are designed to operationalize the Income-tax Act, 2025, ensuring a seamless transition from the current regime. The emphasis is on leveraging technology, reducing interpretational ambiguities, and fostering a more taxpayer-friendly environment.\n\n## Key Changes and Their Impact: What's New for Us?\n\nLet's talk specifics. The draft rules touch upon several critical areas, from compliance requirements for day-to-day transactions to significant changes in reporting and valuation.\n\n### Rationalization of PAN Quoting Requirements\n\nThis is a big one, especially for common transactions. The monetary thresholds for mandatory quoting of **Permanent Account Number (PAN)** have seen a significant upward revision. This move aims to reduce the compliance burden for smaller transactions while still ensuring traceability for larger ones.\n\nHere's a quick comparison of some notable changes:\n\n| Old Provision (Income-tax Rules, 1962) | New Provision (Draft Income-tax Rules, 2026) |\n| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |\n| Cash deposits exceeding ₹50,000 in a day with a banking company or cooperative bank required PAN. | Cash deposits or withdrawals aggregating to **₹10 lakh or more** in a financial year, across one or more accounts, will require PAN. |\n| Sale or purchase of a motor vehicle or vehicle (other than two-wheelers) required PAN. | Purchase of motor vehicles (including motorcycles) exceeding **₹5 lakh** will require PAN. |\n| Hotel or restaurant bills exceeding ₹50,000 required PAN. | Hotel or restaurant bills, convention centres, banquet halls, or payments to event management for services exceeding **₹1 lakh** will require PAN. |\n| Immovable property transactions exceeding ₹10 lakh required PAN. | Immovable property transactions (purchase, sale, gift, or joint development agreement) exceeding **₹20 lakh** will require PAN. |\n\n*Dekho*, these revised thresholds are a practical step towards aligning compliance requirements with current economic realities and inflation. For many individuals and small businesses, this will mean fewer instances where PAN is mandatory, simplifying their day-to-day financial activities.\n\n### Perquisites and Employee Benefits\n\nThe draft rules also propose a rationalization of perquisite valuation. For example, the value of tax-free perquisites related to official vehicles and free meals provided by employers is proposed to be revised upwards. This adjustment reflects market realities and provides some relief to both employers and employees. *Thoda sa relief toh banta hai!*\n\n### Expanded Definition of Electronic Payments: Hello CBDC!\n\nIn a nod to the evolving digital landscape, the Central Board of Direct Taxes has explicitly included **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)** as an accepted mode of electronic payment. This is a forward-looking step, embracing new forms of digital currency and integrating them into the tax framework.\n\n### Redefined 'Accountant' for Certification Purposes\n\nThis particular change is quite significant for our fraternity. The definition of an 'accountant' for certification purposes under the new law has been tightened. Individual professionals will now require a minimum of **10 years of experience** and annual receipts exceeding **₹50 lakh** in the preceding year to qualify for certain certifications. For partners in firms providing accountancy or valuation services, the firm's annual receipts must exceed **₹3 crore**. This is a clear move towards enhancing the quality and accountability of professional certifications.\n\n### Simplified Forms and Digital Convenience\n\nA major highlight is the simplification and standardization of the new income tax forms. Instead of the existing alphanumeric nomenclature, forms will now be identified by serial numbers 1-190. The forms are designed to be \"smart,\" incorporating features for automated reconciliation and pre-fill capabilities. This will significantly reduce errors, streamline the filing process, and enhance the overall user experience. *Technology ka sahi istemal, indeed!*\n\n## Your Chance to Shape the Future: Provide Feedback!\n\nThe CBDT has explicitly stated that the draft rules are in the public domain for a 15-day period, ending on **February 22, 2026**. This is a golden opportunity for all stakeholders – taxpayers, tax professionals, industry bodies – to review the proposals and provide considered feedback. The department is seeking inputs specifically on simplifying statutory language, reducing litigation and interpretational disputes, lowering the compliance burden, and identifying redundant or obsolete rules and forms.\n\nYou can submit your comments and suggestions on the official Income Tax e-filing portal. Just head to their feedback section, complete the OTP verification, and share your thoughts on the specific rules or forms. Our collective expertise can truly make a difference in shaping the final version of these rules.\n\n## Conclusion: A Step Towards a Simpler Tax Regime\n\nThe release of the Draft Income-tax Rules, 2026, marks a pivotal moment in India's direct tax administration. The intent is clear: to move towards a simpler, more transparent, and technologically driven tax regime. While the full impact will only be seen once these rules are finalized and implemented from April 1, 2026, the current draft signals a strong commitment to ease of compliance and reduction of litigation.\n\nAs tax professionals, it's *apni zimmedari* to thoroughly analyze these draft rules, understand their implications, and provide constructive feedback. Let's engage actively in this consultation process to ensure that the final Income-tax Rules, 2026, are robust, equitable, and truly beneficial for everyone.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/feedback-home.aspx)\n\n*Published on: 12 February 2026*",
