Well, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has stepped in with a significant move, bringing much-needed clarity and streamlining to the adjudication process. Through its **Notification S.O. 698(E) dated February 10, 2026**, the MCA has appointed various Registrars of Companies (RoCs) as Adjudicating Officers under **Section 454 of the Companies Act, 2013**, but with a crucial twist: **revised territorial jurisdictions**. This is a big one, effective from **February 16, 2026**, and it’s going to impact how non-compliances are handled across the country.\n\n### Why the Change? Decoding the MCA's Intent\n\nYou might be thinking, \"What was the *zaroorat* for this overhaul?\" The answer lies in enhancing administrative efficiency, ensuring faster disposal of adjudication matters, and ultimately, promoting the ease of doing business. Earlier, there could be ambiguities, and while the intent was always clear, the practical application sometimes faced hurdles due to overlapping or less-defined jurisdictional boundaries. The government's continuous push towards decriminalization of minor defaults and reducing the burden on the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also plays a key role here. By empowering RoCs with clearer, specific adjudicatory powers and well-defined areas of operation, the MCA is reinforcing the first line of defense in corporate compliance.\n\nThis move is not just a cosmetic change; it's a strategic realignment to strengthen the regulatory oversight mechanism. It’s about ensuring that penalties for non-compliance are imposed in a timely and proportionate manner, fostering a culture of adherence rather than mere punitive action.\n\n### The Heart of the Matter: What's New with RoC Jurisdictions?\n\nThe core of this notification lies in its explicit delineation of **territorial jurisdictions** for each Registrar of Companies when acting as an Adjudicating Officer. This supersedes previous notifications issued in 2015 (S.O. 831(E) dated March 24, 2015) and 2019 (S.O. 2650(E) dated July 25, 2019).\n\nHere's a snapshot of the major shifts:\n\n*   **Granular Demarcation:** The notification provides a detailed mapping of states, union territories, and even districts to specific RoCs. This means less guesswork about \"mera jurisdiction kaun sa hai?\" for companies and professionals alike.\n*   **Multi-Zone Approach for Large States:** For states with a high volume of corporate activity, such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, the jurisdiction has been split into multiple zones. For instance, Delhi now has RoC, National Capital Territory of Delhi-I and RoC, National Capital Territory of Delhi-II, each covering distinct districts. This zonal division aims to distribute the caseload effectively and ensure swifter resolution of adjudication proceedings.\n*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The revised framework ensures clear jurisdictional assignments across all states and union territories, including the North-Eastern states, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, thereby promoting uniform adjudication across the nation.\n\nTo understand the practical impact, let’s quickly look at how the Adjudicating Officer jurisdiction has evolved:\n\n| Aspect                     | Old Provision (S.O. 831(E) dated March 24, 2015)                                          | New Provision (S.O. 698(E) dated February 10, 2026)                                                                                                              |\n| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **RoC Delhi Jurisdiction** | Union territory of Delhi and whole State of Haryana.                         | Divided into National Capital Territory of Delhi-I (South, Southwest, New, Southeast, East Delhi districts) and National Capital Territory of Delhi-II (Central, West, North, Northwest, Northeast, Shahdara districts). |\n| **RoC Maharashtra**        | Mumbai: Whole State of Maharashtra except Pune, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Solapur, Satara, Sangli, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg districts. | Now likely split into multiple jurisdictions (e.g., Mumbai-I, Mumbai-II, Nagpur) for efficiency. (Specific details of all splits are extensive, but the principle of more granular division holds) |\n| **Supersession**           | Superseded by subsequent notifications.                                   | Supersedes S.O. 831(E) dated March 24, 2015 and S.O. 2650(E) dated July 25, 2019.                                                                    |\n| **Effective Date**         | March 24, 2015 (came into immediate effect).                                    | February 16, 2026.                                                                                                                                  |\n\nThis updated jurisdictional mapping is crucial for professionals and companies. It means understanding exactly which RoC is responsible for adjudication in your specific area, ensuring that applications and responses are directed correctly, avoiding unnecessary delays. *Ab idhar-udhar bhatakne ki zaroorat nahi padegi!*\n\n### The Appellate Mechanism: Where do you go from here?\n\nThe notification also re-emphasizes the appellate mechanism. Any appeals against the orders passed by these newly empowered Adjudicating Officers shall lie before the concerned **Regional Directors (RDs)** who have jurisdiction over the adjudicating offices. This appellate framework itself was updated by the Government of India through a separate notification (S.O. 4852(E)) dated October 23, 2025. This means a clear two-tier system is in place: RoCs at the first level for adjudication, and RDs for appeals. This structured approach is designed to provide quick and accessible redressal for stakeholders.\n\n### What about Pending Cases?\n\nThe MCA has also addressed the elephant in the room: pending proceedings. The notification clearly states that all proceedings pending before Adjudicating Officers, and appeals pending before Regional Directors as of the commencement date (February 16, 2026), will be dealt with in accordance with this revised framework. This ensures a smooth transition and avoids any ambiguity for ongoing cases.\n\n### A Parallel Move: LLP Act Adjudication Also Revamped\n\nIt's worth noting that the MCA simultaneously revamped the adjudication framework under the **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) Act, 2008**, through Notification S.O. 696(E) also dated February 10, 2026. This parallel move, also effective February 16, 2026, designates specific RoCs as Adjudicating Officers for LLP-related contraventions, superseding an earlier notification from February 2022. This reinforces the consistent approach by the MCA across both company and LLP regulatory frameworks.\n\n### Final Thoughts: Towards a More Efficient Corporate Governance\n\nThis notification from the MCA is a progressive step. By clarifying the roles and jurisdictions of RoCs as Adjudicating Officers, the government is signalling its commitment to a more transparent, efficient, and responsive corporate regulatory environment. For us professionals – CAs, CSs, and legal advisors – it means a clearer pathway for compliance management and penalty adjudication. It’s an opportunity to advise our clients with greater precision and navigate the regulatory landscape with more confidence. The enhanced clarity, coupled with the emphasis on proportionality and timely resolution, will undoubtedly contribute to the ease of doing business in India. *Yeh toh ek accha kadam hai, jo business karna aur bhi aasaan banayega!*\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2026/270055.pdf)\n\n*Published on: 16 February 2026*",
