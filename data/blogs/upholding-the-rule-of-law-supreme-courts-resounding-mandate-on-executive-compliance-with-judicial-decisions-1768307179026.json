As Chartered Accountants and Legal Analysts, we often find ourselves navigating the intricate interplay between law and administration. Sometimes, despite clear judicial pronouncements, the executive machinery seems to drag its feet, leaving us and our clients in a perpetual state of uncertainty. *Kayi baar toh aisa lagta hai ki judgment toh aa gaya, par usko implement karna ek naya battle ban gaya hai, hai na?*\n\nWell, a recent pronouncement from the Supreme Court of India comes as a much-needed reaffirmation, serving as a powerful reminder to the executive that judicial decisions are not merely advisory but **binding commands** that demand faithful implementation. The judgment, delivered on **January 5, 2026**, in the case of **Adani Power Limited & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.**, once again underscored the constitutional obligation of the executive to uphold the rule of law by promptly and sincerely giving effect to final judicial decisions.\n\n### The Genesis of the Mandate: Why This Reaffirmation Matters\n\nThe core of our democratic structure rests on the principle of **separation of powers**, where each organ – the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary – operates within its defined boundaries while also acting as a check on the others. The judiciary's role, particularly that of the Supreme Court, is to interpret the law and declare its true meaning. Once the highest court pronounces a judgment, it becomes the law of the land, binding on all.\n\nHowever, history is replete with instances where the executive, through various means, attempts to circumvent or delay the implementation of judicial decisions. This not only erodes public trust in the justice system but also undermines the very essence of the **rule of law**. It sends a message that court orders can be, *chalo, theek hai, thoda ignore kar dete hain*, which is a dangerous precedent for any constitutional democracy.\n\nIn **Adani Power Limited & Anr.**, the Supreme Court addressed this head-on. The case arose from a prolonged dispute concerning the levy of customs duty on electricity generated in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and supplied to the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA). An earlier High Court judgment had already declared this levy unconstitutional, a decision that had attained finality after the Supreme Court declined to interfere. Yet, the executive seemed to resist this finality through subsequent notifications that essentially sought to re-impose the duty in an altered form.\n\n### Dissecting the Judgment: Facts, Provisions, and the Court's Unambiguous Stance\n\nLet's break down the key aspects of this significant judgment:\n\n#### Facts of the Case: A Tale of Persistent Litigation\n*   **The Dispute:** The central issue revolved around the legality of levying customs duty on electricity produced within an SEZ and supplied to the DTA.\n*   **Prior Ruling:** A High Court had previously ruled that such a levy was unconstitutional, finding that there was no valid charging event under **Section 12 of the Customs Act, 1962**, for an intra-national supply of electricity to be treated as an \"import into India\". This judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court, thus reaching finality.\n*   **Executive Action:** Despite this, the Union of India issued subsequent notifications (e.g., Notifications Nos. 25/2010-Cus., 91/2010-Cus., and 26/2012-Cus.) effectively trying to continue the levy, albeit with altered rates or through exemption powers. This led Adani Power to seek reliefs challenging these continued levies.\n\n#### Legal Provisions Under Scrutiny:\nThe Court meticulously examined several key provisions:\n*   **Article 265 of the Constitution of India:** This fundamental constitutional principle states that \"No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.\" The Court reiterated that taxation must be backed by explicit legislative sanction.\n*   **Article 14 of the Constitution of India:** The right to equality and the prohibition of arbitrary state action.\n*   **Section 12 of the Customs Act, 1962:** The charging section for customs duty, which applies to goods imported into India.\n*   **Section 25 of the Customs Act, 1962:** This section grants the Central Government the power to issue exemption notifications.\n*   **Section 30 of the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005:** Deals with the treatment of goods removed from an SEZ to the DTA, stating they shall be chargeable to customs duty \"as if imported.\"\n*   **Rule 47(3) of the SEZ Rules, 2006:** A mechanism for duty adjustment on inputs.\n\n#### The Court's Unwavering Decision:\nThe bench comprising Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice N.V. Anjaria delivered a categorical judgment, reaffirming several critical principles:\n*   **Judicial Decisions as Binding Commands:** The Court emphatically stated that judicial decisions, once they attain finality, are **binding commands of law** and not mere advisory opinions. They are not suggestions, *balki ek pakka aadesh hai*.\n*   **Executive's Constitutional Obligation:** The executive is **constitutionally obligated to faithfully implement such decisions** rather than resisting them through altered subordinate instruments.\n*   **No Colourable Exercise of Power:** The Court found that the government's attempt to impose customs duty through \"exemption\" notifications under Section 25 of the Customs Act was a **colourable exercise of delegated power**. The power to exempt is not a power to tax; a delegate cannot achieve indirectly what it lacks the authority to do directly.\n*   **Binding Precedent:** The Supreme Court stressed the **binding force of judicial precedent**, highlighting that a coordinate High Court bench could not narrow an earlier final judgment. The principle of *stare decisis et non quieta movere* (to stand by what is decided and not to disturb what is settled) is an institutional necessity, ensuring stability and predictability in judicial outcomes.\n*   **State's Duty to Exemplify Obedience:** The judgment underscored that the **State must exemplify obedience to judgments, not resistance to them**. This is crucial for maintaining the public interest that there be an end to litigation (*interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium*).\n*   **Outcome:** The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned High Court judgment, and declared that the levy of customs duty on electricity from the SEZ to DTA for the specified period was without authority of law. It further directed the respondents (Union of India and customs authorities) to refund the amounts collected.\n\n### Conclusion: A Clear Message for Governance\n\nThis judgment from January 5, 2026, is a pivotal one. It serves as a stern reminder to the executive that constitutional governance mandates respect for judicial mandates. The Supreme Court has unequivocally reinforced that final judicial decisions are sacrosanct and must be implemented in letter and spirit. Any attempt to circumvent them, whether through legislative amendments (unless they alter the very basis of the judgment) or through executive notifications, will not pass judicial muster.\n\nFor professionals like us, this means that once a judgment attains finality, we can advise our clients with greater confidence that the executive's actions must align with it. It empowers us to hold the administration accountable and ensures that the principles of justice and legality prevail. This ruling is a strong endorsement of the judiciary's role as the guardian of the Constitution and a bulwark against executive overreach. *Yeh ek clear message hai ki kanoon sabse upar hai, aur uski palna karna sabki zimmedari hai, khaaskar sarkaar ki.*\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG8MW1FTyDX777sm65oKITyGxSSKv44qqQy0ELe2P8gepnxBsE4gV2_-buZevWtUrU61eLglE6CNBErkskf_cS2tfEoHKaDSfYTKDviFtAFnJTAB5oXZhykYdU7ZmnIpSSjxI7MWOeWz_LiHwCpfKpzXO7hCpO4cauwvP9TIF0Hj7cwIMldqF3Sa_7KQ9gy)\n\n*Published on: 13 January 2026*",
