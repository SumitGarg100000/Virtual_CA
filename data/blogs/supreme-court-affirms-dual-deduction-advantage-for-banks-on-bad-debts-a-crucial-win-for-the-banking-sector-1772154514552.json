One area that has consistently sparked debate and litigation is the treatment of **bad and doubtful debts** under the Income Tax Act, 1961. So, when the Supreme Court of India issues an order touching upon this, you can bet the entire banking sector sits up and takes notice.\n\nRecently, on **February 25, 2026**, the Supreme Court delivered a significant, albeit succinct, order that has reinforced a long-standing position beneficial to banks. The apex court declined to interfere with a Bombay High Court judgment, effectively upholding the practice of banks maintaining separate provisions for rural and non-rural advances for the purpose of setting off bad debts under **Section 36(1)(viia)** read with **Section 36(1)(vii)** of the Income Tax Act, 1961. *Ab yeh toh ek bada relief hai!*\n\n## The Core of the Contention: Decoding Section 36(1)(vii) and 36(1)(viia)\n\nTo truly appreciate the implications of this order, let's quickly demystify the relevant provisions:\n\n*   **Section 36(1)(vii):** This section allows a deduction for **actual bad debts written off** as irrecoverable in the books of accounts. For a long time, the interpretation of \"written off\" was a hotbed of litigation, but judicial pronouncements have largely clarified that a mere debit to the Profit & Loss account and a credit to the provision for bad debts account, effectively reducing the net worth of the assets, suffices.\n*   **Section 36(1)(viia):** Introduced with a specific objective, this section allows banks (scheduled, non-scheduled Indian banks, and cooperative banks, generally) to claim a deduction for a **provision for bad and doubtful debts**. The key differentiator here is that it permits deduction on a *provision basis* – essentially, an anticipated loss – without the need for actual write-off. A significant aspect of this provision is the additional benefit it extends to provisions related to **rural advances**, recognizing the higher inherent risk associated with lending in rural areas.\n\nThe legislative intent behind Section 36(1)(viia) was clear: to promote and encourage rural lending by providing a tax incentive for creating such provisions.\n\n## The Knotty Issue: Are the Provisions Mutually Exclusive or Complementary?\n\nThe bone of contention, which reached the Supreme Court via a Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed by the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax-2 against Central Bank of India, was whether banks could claim **separate deductions** for actual write-offs under Section 36(1)(vii) and for provisions made for rural advances under Section 36(1)(viia). The Revenue's argument typically revolves around the apprehension of a \"double deduction\" – *ek hi cheez pe do baar deduction kaise milega?*\n\nHowever, judicial interpretations have consistently held that while distinct, these sections are **complementary** and not mutually exclusive. The **proviso to Section 36(1)(vii)** is crucial here. It stipulates that the deduction for actual bad debts written off under Section 36(1)(vii) shall be limited to the amount by which such bad debts exceed the credit balance in the provision for bad and doubtful debts account made under Section 36(1)(viia). Furthermore, any bad debt written off that relates to rural advances must first be debited against the provision made under Section 36(1)(viia).\n\nThis mechanism ensures that there isn't an unwarranted double benefit. It effectively means that the provision created under Section 36(1)(viia) acts as a sort of \"first charge\" for actual bad debts, especially those arising from rural advances. Once that provision is utilized, the balance of actually written-off bad debts can be claimed under Section 36(1)(vii).\n\n## The Supreme Court's Unwavering Stance: What the Latest Order Means\n\nIn the specific case involving Central Bank of India (for Assessment Year 2008-09), the Bombay High Court had already ruled that no substantial question of law arose, as the issue was covered by earlier pronouncements. The High Court had noted that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) had followed the Supreme Court's own decision in the case of **Catholic Syrian Bank Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (2012)**.\n\nThe latest order dated February 25, 2026, by a bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar and Justice K. Vinod Chandran, simply **dismissed the Special Leave Petition**, finding \"no good ground to interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court\".\n\nWhat this translates to for banks and tax professionals is a clear reaffirmation:\n*   **Separate Identity:** The unique nature and purpose of Section 36(1)(viia) for creating provisions for bad and doubtful debts (especially rural advances) remain distinct.\n*   **Deduction Continuity:** Banks can continue to claim deductions under both Section 36(1)(viia) and Section 36(1)(vii), subject to the reconciliation and adjustment mechanism prescribed by the proviso to Section 36(1)(vii) and Section 36(2)(v).\n*   **Reduced Litigation Risk:** This order brings much-needed clarity and stability, likely reducing future litigation on this specific aspect. It's a signal that the courts are consistently upholding the legislative intent behind these provisions. *This is definitely a relief for compliance teams, isn't it?*\n\n## Conclusion: A Prudent Path for Prudent Lending\n\nThis recent Supreme Court order is more than just a procedural dismissal; it's a significant endorsement of the established legal position concerning bad debt deductions for banks. It acknowledges the specific financial dynamics and risks inherent in the banking sector, particularly in the context of rural lending. For banks, this means continued access to crucial tax benefits that support their financial health and encourage their role in fostering economic growth, especially in underserved areas. For us, as tax professionals, it means another settled point of law, allowing us to advise our banking clients with greater certainty and confidence. The interplay of Sections 36(1)(vii) and 36(1)(viia) remains a sophisticated, yet well-interpreted, framework that balances prudential accounting with sound tax policy.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Check Latest Orders on Supreme Court of India](https://main.sci.gov.in/latest-orders)\n\n*Published on: 27 February 2026*",
