For years, the levy, or even the looming threat of a levy, of customs duty on power consumed by Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units has been a recurring pain point, creating an unwarranted cost burden and dampening the very spirit of these export-oriented enclaves. Businesses have been seeking clarity, and frankly, some relief from this administrative quagmire.\n\nWell, good news has finally arrived! In a significant development, the Supreme Court of India has unequivocally struck down the imposition of customs duty on power used by SEZ units, delivering a much-needed shot in the arm for businesses operating within these zones. This ruling is not just a legal victory; it's a reaffirmation of the core principles underpinning India's SEZ policy.\n\n### The Gnawing Uncertainty: A Pre-Judgment Scenario\n\nThink about it – **SEZs** are conceived as duty-free enclaves, deemed to be outside the customs territory of India for tariff purposes. The entire ecosystem is designed to provide a hassle-free environment to promote exports and attract foreign investment. Yet, the question of whether electricity – a fundamental and indispensable input for almost every manufacturing or service activity – should attract customs duty has historically been a grey area, often leading to protracted disputes and audits.\n\nRevenue authorities, in some instances, argued that electricity, whether procured from outside the SEZ or even generated within it but with inputs procured from the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA), constitutes 'goods' and, upon entry into the SEZ, should attract customs duty as if it were an import. This interpretation, to many, felt like a classic case of *\"ulta pulta\"* – turning the very purpose of an SEZ on its head. It forced SEZ units to either absorb these additional costs or engage in prolonged litigation, diverting precious resources.\n\n### Decoding the Legal Tangle: SEZ Act vs. Customs Act Interpretations\n\nThe core of the dispute lay in reconciling the provisions of the **Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 (SEZ Act)**, with certain interpretations of the **Customs Act, 1962**. The SEZ Act is a special law, specifically designed to foster economic growth through designated zones. It emphatically states that goods brought into an SEZ for authorized operations shall be exempt from duties of customs. The legislative intent was crystal clear: to treat SEZs as \"foreign territory\" for customs purposes, thereby eliminating the burden of duties on inputs used for export production.\n\nHowever, the revenue department sometimes sought to interpret the definition of \"goods\" under the Customs Act broadly, contending that electricity, being movable property, falls within this definition. Consequently, its supply into or consumption within an SEZ was occasionally viewed as an 'import' triggering customs duty. This narrow reading often overlooked the broader scheme and specific exemptions granted under the SEZ framework, creating a significant point of contention for businesses. This conflicting interpretation often led to notices and demands, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty.\n\n### The Apex Court's Verdict: A Breath of Fresh Air for SEZ Units\n\nThe Supreme Court, after meticulously examining the statutory framework and the legislative intent behind the SEZ Act, has now put this debate to rest. The Court emphasized that the **SEZ Act, 2005**, along with the **SEZ Rules, 2006**, provides a comprehensive code for the establishment and operation of SEZs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Court's rationale:\n*   **Spirit of SEZ Act:** The Court reiterated that SEZs are established with the primary objective of promoting exports, and providing a duty-free environment for this purpose. Imposing customs duty on essential inputs like power would directly contravene this fundamental objective.\n*   **\"Deemed Foreign Territory\":** The judgment highlighted the legal fiction that an SEZ is deemed to be a territory outside the customs frontiers of India. Transactions involving the supply or consumption of power within an SEZ for authorized operations cannot, therefore, be treated as 'import into India' for the levy of customs duty.\n*   **Holistic Interpretation:** The Hon'ble Court adopted a holistic and harmonious interpretation of the relevant statutes, concluding that the specific provisions and intent of the SEZ Act must prevail in such matters, safeguarding the benefits intended for SEZ units.\n\nThis ruling definitively clarifies that for power consumed in authorized operations within an SEZ, no customs duty is leviable, irrespective of its source (whether captive generation within the SEZ, procurement from DTA, or import into the SEZ). *Yeh rule ab applicable nahi hai!*\n\n### Implications and Way Forward for Businesses\n\nThis judgment is a monumental relief for SEZ developers and units across the country. Here's what it means:\n\n*   **Cost Certainty:** Businesses can now breathe easy, with a clear understanding that their primary power costs will not be inflated by customs duties. This certainty will significantly improve financial planning and operational efficiency.\n*   **Potential for Refunds:** Units that have previously paid customs duty on power under protest or through other mechanisms might now be eligible to claim refunds. Businesses should immediately review their past payments and explore avenues for claiming back unjustly levied duties. *Apna paisa, wapas aayega!*\n*   **Boost to Investment:** By removing a significant administrative and financial hurdle, the ruling makes SEZs even more attractive for new investments, both domestic and foreign. It reinforces India's commitment to providing a globally competitive environment for manufacturing and services.\n*   **Reduced Litigation:** The clarity provided by the Supreme Court will drastically reduce the scope for future disputes and litigation concerning customs duty on power in SEZs, freeing up resources for productive activities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to strike down customs duty on power consumed by SEZ units is a landmark judgment that fortifies the foundational principles of India's SEZ policy. It underscores the importance of interpreting tax laws in alignment with their stated objectives and legislative intent. For businesses operating in SEZs, this ruling is not just a legal victory but a powerful affirmation of the government's commitment to ease of doing business and promoting export-led growth. It's time to recalibrate your cost structures and confidently power ahead with your SEZ operations!\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://main.sci.gov.in/judgments)\n\n*Published on: 6 January 2026*",
