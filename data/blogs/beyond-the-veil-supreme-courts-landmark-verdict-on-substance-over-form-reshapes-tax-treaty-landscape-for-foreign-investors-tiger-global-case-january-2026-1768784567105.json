Just when you think you've found a clear path, a landmark judgment comes along and asks us to re-evaluate everything. The Supreme Court of India's recent decision in the much-anticipated **Tiger Global** case, delivered on January 16, 2026, is precisely one such moment. It's a powerful reinforcement of the **\"substance over form\"** doctrine, sending a clear message to foreign investors and fund managers alike.\n\nThis isn't just another tax ruling; it’s a significant recalibration of India's stance on treaty shopping and impermissible tax avoidance. If you've been relying solely on formalistic compliance, ab yeh time aa gaya hai to dig deeper into the true commercial rationale behind your structures.\n\n## The Genesis of the Dispute: Tiger Global and the Flipkart Sale\n\nThe case revolved around the taxability of capital gains arising from the sale of shares in Flipkart Private Limited (a Singapore entity) by Mauritius-based entities of Tiger Global (namely, Tiger Global International II Holdings, Tiger Global International III Holdings, and Tiger Global International IV Holdings) to Walmart in 2018.\n\nTiger Global, a prominent venture capital investor, had routed its investments through Mauritius-based entities, as was a common practice, relying on the favorable provisions of the **India-Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)**. Historically, under this DTAA, capital gains on the sale of shares were taxable only in Mauritius, not in India. Tiger Global argued for exemption, citing valid **Tax Residency Certificates (TRCs)** issued by Mauritian authorities and the **grandfathering provision** under the DTAA for investments made before April 1, 2017.\n\nHowever, the Indian tax authorities took a different view. They contended that the Mauritius entities were merely \"conduit entities\" or \"see-through entities\" lacking genuine commercial substance, and that the effective control and decision-making for these investments lay outside Mauritius, specifically in the USA. The Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) initially sided with the Revenue, concluding that the arrangement was *prima facie* designed for tax avoidance. The Delhi High Court, however, overturned the AAR's decision, granting relief to Tiger Global. This set the stage for the Supreme Court's definitive pronouncement.\n\n## The Supreme Court's Incisive Analysis: A Deep Dive into \"Substance\"\n\nA bench of Justices R. Mahadevan and J.B. Pardiwala meticulously examined the intricacies of the transaction, ultimately overturning the Delhi High Court's judgment and affirming the AAR's conclusions. The apex court's decision is a multi-faceted one, touching upon several critical aspects of international tax planning:\n\n### 1. TRC: Necessary, But Not Sufficient Proof\n\nFor decades, the **Tax Residency Certificate (TRC)** was considered almost sacrosanct under the India-Mauritius DTAA, creating a strong presumption of residency and beneficial ownership. However, the Supreme Court has now decisively clarified that while a TRC is an *eligibility document*, it is **not conclusive proof** of entitlement to treaty benefits.\n\nThe Court emphasized that Indian tax authorities are well within their rights to **look beyond formal paperwork** and inquire into the \"substance\" of a transaction, especially in cases of suspected treaty abuse or where the entity lacks genuine commercial substance. This is a significant shift from earlier judicial precedents that accorded decisive weight to TRCs.\n\n### 2. GAAR and JAAR: Dual Blades Against Avoidance\n\nThe judgment powerfully underscores the complementary role of the **General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR)** and the judicial doctrine of **\"substance over form\"** (often referred to as Judicial Anti-Avoidance Rules, or JAAR).\n\n*   **GAAR's Expanded Reach:** The Court clarified that GAAR can apply to *any arrangement* where a \"tax benefit\" is claimed on or after April 1, 2017, **irrespective of when the investment was made**. This effectively means that even pre-2017 investments, which were thought to be \"grandfathered,\" are now susceptible to GAAR scrutiny if the arrangement lacks commercial substance and yields a tax benefit post-April 2017. This is a crucial takeaway for legacy structures.\n*   **JAAR Remains Potent:** The SC also reiterated that even if GAAR provisions are technically not applicable, the broader **judicial anti-avoidance principles** (JAAR) based on 'substance over form' can still be invoked by tax authorities to deny treaty benefits where the structure is a sham or lacks genuine commercial purpose.\n\n### 3. Grandfathering Provision and Indirect Transfers: A Narrower Interpretation\n\nA key contention was the applicability of Article 13(3A) of the India-Mauritius DTAA, which grandfathered capital gains on shares acquired before April 1, 2017. The Supreme Court ruled that this grandfathering provision, along with the related Limitation of Benefits (LOB) clause, applies **only to direct transfers of shares of Indian companies**.\n\nIn the Tiger Global case, the sale involved shares of a Singapore company (Flipkart Singapore), even though it derived substantial value from Indian assets. The Court held that such indirect transfers fall under the residuary Article 13(4) of the DTAA and therefore **do not enjoy LOB or grandfathering protection**. This distinction is vital for foreign investors structuring their investments through multi-layered entities.\n\n### 4. Taxation in Residence State is a Prerequisite; Burden of Proof on Taxpayer\n\nThe Court underscored that the object of a tax treaty is to prevent double taxation, not to facilitate tax avoidance. Therefore, the applicability of treaty benefits is subject to the relevant transaction being taxable in the resident state.\n\nFurther, the SC noted that Indian tax law now places the **burden of proof on the taxpayer** to rebut the presumption of tax avoidance, once a *prima facie* case is established by the Revenue. This means taxpayers must proactively demonstrate the bona fide commercial purpose of their arrangements.\n\n## Implications for Foreign Investors: A Call for Greater Scrutiny\n\nThe Supreme Court's verdict is a game-changer. It signals a fundamental shift in how India interprets and enforces tax rules on foreign investments, particularly those routed through treaty jurisdictions like Mauritius and Singapore.\n\n*   **Rethink Existing Structures:** Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), private equity (PE) funds, and hedge funds utilizing Mauritius or Singapore-based structures for their Indian investments, including those made prior to April 2017, must immediately re-evaluate their arrangements for genuine commercial substance. The focus will now be on the \"real economic purpose\" rather than just the \"legal structure.\"\n*   **TRC No Longer a Shield:** Simply holding a valid TRC will not be enough. Taxpayers will need to demonstrate that their offshore entities have genuine business activity, independent control, and decision-making authority, rather than being mere conduits.\n*   **Increased Scrutiny on Indirect Transfers:** The clarification regarding grandfathering for indirect transfers means that sales of shares in offshore entities that derive substantial value from Indian assets will face heightened scrutiny.\n*   **Enhanced Due Diligence:** Going forward, robust documentation and demonstrable commercial rationale for every step of an investment structure will be paramount. Expect tax authorities to delve deeper into the *Place of Effective Management (POEM)* and actual operational substance.\n\nThe ruling has sparked discussions about its potential impact on India's pitch for tax certainty and foreign direct investment. While some argue it might introduce uncertainty for investors, it also reinforces India's sovereign right to tax income arising from its own country and curb artificial structures.\n\n## Final Thoughts: A New Era of Tax Transparency\n\nThis judgment is a powerful reminder that in the world of tax, form can only take you so far; ultimately, **substance will prevail**. The Supreme Court has drawn a clear line between legitimate tax planning and impermissible tax avoidance. For us professionals, this means a renewed focus on ensuring that cross-border investment structures are not just legally compliant on paper, but also economically justifiable and have genuine commercial substance.\n\nThe message is loud and clear: **tax benefits under international treaties are for bona fide investors with real economic presence, not for entities created solely to minimize tax exposure.** It's time for a thorough introspection of our existing structures and a proactive approach to demonstrating economic rationale. *Yeh rule ab applicable nahi hai, ki sirf TRC dikha ke baat ban jaayegi!*\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Visit the Supreme Court of India website for official judgments](https://main.sci.gov.in/)\n\n*Published on: 19 January 2026*",
