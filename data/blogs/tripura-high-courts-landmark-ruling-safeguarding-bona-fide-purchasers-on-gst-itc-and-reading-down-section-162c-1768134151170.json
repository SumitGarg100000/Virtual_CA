Will *you* be denied Input Tax Credit (ITC) for no fault of your own? This uncertainty has been a significant point of contention, often leading to genuine businesses bearing an unfair burden.\n\nIn a much-anticipated move, the Tripura High Court, through its significant judgment dated January 8, 2026, in the case of **M/s Sahil Enterprises v. Union of India & Ors.**, has brought substantial relief and clarity on this vexed issue. The Court has \"read down\" **Section 16(2)(c) of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017**, offering a protective shield to bona fide purchasers. This isn't just another judgment; it’s a crucial interpretive shift that acknowledges ground realities.\n\n### The Ever-Present Challenge: Section 16(2)(c) and the Bona Fide Buyer's Dilemma\n\nLet's rewind a bit. **Section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act** is one of the foundational conditions for availing ITC. It stipulates that ITC is available only if \"the tax charged in respect of such supply has been actually paid to the Government either in cash or through utilization of input tax credit admissible in respect of the said supply.\" Sounds straightforward, right? *But yahan pe hi to saari kahani shuru hoti hai.*\n\nIn practice, this provision often led to a situation where a buyer, having paid the GST amount to their supplier and received proper invoices, would later be denied ITC if the supplier, for whatever reason (default, fraud, or simple error), failed to remit that collected tax to the government. Imagine a scenario: you've genuinely bought goods, paid the full amount including GST, completed all your compliances, and suddenly, the taxman knocks, denying your ITC because your supplier went rogue. This essentially means double taxation for the honest buyer – once while paying the supplier, and again when paying the ITC amount back to the government. This situation felt fundamentally unfair and arbitrary to many.\n\n### The Tripura High Court Steps In: The Sahil Enterprises Case\n\nThe heart of the matter in the **Sahil Enterprises** case revolved around this very predicament. M/s Sahil Enterprises, a registered dealer engaged in the trading of rubber products, had purchased goods from a registered supplier, M/s Sentu Dey, between July 2017 and January 2019. Sahil Enterprises diligently paid GST amounting to ₹1.11 crore to its supplier. While the supplier duly reflected these outward supplies in their GSTR-1 returns, they unfortunately filed 'Nil' GSTR-3B returns, failing to deposit the collected tax with the government.\n\nConsequently, the GST authorities moved against Sahil Enterprises, blocking their electronic credit ledger and issuing a demand notice under **Section 73 of the CGST Act**, denying the ITC on the grounds that the tax had not been actually paid to the government, as per Section 16(2)(c). Aggrieved, Sahil Enterprises challenged this order, also questioning the constitutional validity of Section 16(2)(c) itself.\n\n### Decoding the Judgment: Constitutional Validity Upheld, Provision Read Down\n\nA Division Bench comprising Chief Justice M.S. Ramchandra Rao and Justice S. Datta Purkayastha delivered this crucial verdict. The Court's decision can be broken down into two pivotal parts:\n\n1.  **Constitutional Validity Affirmed:** The High Court first addressed the challenge to the constitutional validity of **Section 16(2)(c)**. It held that the provision is *not* violative of Articles 14 (equality before law), 19(1)(g) (right to practice any profession), 265 (taxes not to be imposed save by authority of law), or 300-A (persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of law) of the Constitution of India. So, the section itself is constitutionally sound.\n2.  **Section 16(2)(c) \"Read Down\":** This is where the game-changer lies. While upholding its constitutional validity, the Court emphatically stated that Section 16(2)(c) **cannot be interpreted to deny ITC to a bona fide purchaser**. The doctrine of \"reading down\" a statutory provision essentially means interpreting it in a way that aligns with the legislative intent and constitutional principles, preventing it from being applied in an overreaching or arbitrary manner.\n\nThe Court's rationale was compelling:\n*   **Impossible Burden:** The purchasing dealer cannot be asked to do the impossible – *ki bhai, aap apne supplier ki GSTR-3B filings aur tax deposits ko monitor karo*. There is no practical or legal mechanism for a buyer to ensure that a seller deposits the collected tax with the government. Expecting this would impose an \"onerous\" and \"impossible\" burden on the bona fide purchaser.\n*   **No Fault, No Penalty:** When there is no allegation of collusion, fraud, or wilful misstatement on the part of the recipient, and the transaction is genuine and bona fide, denying ITC merely due to the supplier's default is unjust. The Court emphasized that if the supplier has fraudulently retained the collected GST, recovery efforts should be directed against the defaulting supplier, not the innocent buyer.\n*   **Preventing Double Taxation:** The very essence of ITC in the GST regime is to prevent cascading effects and double taxation. Denying credit to a genuine buyer defeats this core principle.\n*   **Reliance on Precedents:** The High Court relied heavily on the jurisprudence established by the Delhi High Court in cases like *Quest Merchandising India Pvt. Ltd.* and *Shanti Kiran India (P) Ltd.*, which had been affirmed by the Supreme Court in *Arise India Ltd.* and subsequent cases, highlighting a consistent judicial view on protecting bona fide purchasers.\n\nAs a result, the Tripura High Court set aside the demand order against M/s Sahil Enterprises and directed the GST authorities to forthwith allow the denied ITC of ₹1.11 crore.\n\n### What Does \"Reading Down\" Mean for Your ITC?\n\nThis judgment provides significant relief and a clear directive for tax authorities. Here are the key takeaways for professionals and businesses:\n\n*   **Bona Fide Transactions are Protected:** If you are a genuine buyer, have paid the tax to your registered supplier, possess valid tax invoices, and the transaction itself is not collusive or fraudulent, you should not be denied ITC solely because your supplier defaulted in remitting the tax to the government.\n*   **Focus Shifts to Supplier (in honest cases):** The burden of recovering the tax will now squarely fall on the defaulting supplier, not the unsuspecting recipient.\n*   **Documentation is Key:** While this judgment is a big win, maintaining impeccable records – proper invoices, proof of payment to the supplier, and evidence of genuine transactions – remains paramount.\n*   **Limits to Protection:** The protection offered by \"reading down\" is explicitly for *bona fide* transactions. If there's any evidence of collusion, fraud, or non-genuine transactions to defraud the revenue, Section 16(2)(c) can still be invoked to deny ITC.\n\nThis judgment from the Tripura High Court is a welcome development, echoing the sentiments of justice and practicality that many in the professional community have advocated for. It reinforces the principle that an honest taxpayer should not suffer for the actions of another, fostering greater trust and certainty in the GST ecosystem. *Hopefully, isse ITC ke mamle mein genuine buyers ko thodi aur rahat milegi.*\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Search Judgments on the High Court of Tripura website here](https://highcourt.tripura.gov.in/e-scr)\n\n*Published on: 11 January 2026*",
