  "content": "# Supreme Court Relaxes Experience Rule for CA Tribunal Members\n\nThe Supreme Court has clarified that Chartered Accountants (CAs) are not required to possess a minimum of 25 years of experience to serve as technical members in tribunals, including the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT). This decision follows a request from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).\n\n*   The Court deemed the 25-year experience clause arbitrary.\n*   This ruling aligns CAs with advocates, for whom a similar age-based eligibility requirement (minimum 50 years of age) for tribunal appointments was previously struck down as unconstitutional.\n*   The Supreme Court noted that the 25-year experience condition would effectively limit CAs from entering service before the age of 50.\n*   This clarification is an addition to the Court's November 19 judgment, which invalidated significant parts of the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021. The Union Government is instructed to incorporate this observation when drafting new legislation.",
