The Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICMAI) ne apne members holding a Certificate of Practice (CoP) ke liye mandatory Continuing Professional Education (CPE) requirements ko complete karne ki deadline extend kar di hai.\n\nThe Council of ICMAI has observed that many practicing members had not met the mandatory CPE hours requirement.
