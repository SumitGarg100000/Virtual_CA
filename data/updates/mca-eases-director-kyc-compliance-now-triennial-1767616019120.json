  "content": "# MCA Eases Director KYC Compliance: Now Triennial!\n\nEk important update hai! Government ne Directors ke liye KYC compliance ki frequency ko annual se badhkar triennial (teen saal mein ek baar) kar diya hai. This is a significant step towards easing the compliance burden.\n\nThe Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has issued Notification No. G.S.R. 943(E) dated December 31, 2025, to implement this change. This amendment modifies Rule 12A of the Companies (Appointment and Qualification of Directors) Rules, 2014, and will come into effect from March 31, 2026.\n\nHere are the key details:\n\n*   **Old Requirement:** Directors had to file e-Form DIR-3-KYC annually by September 30th of each financial year.\n*   **New Requirement:** Now, every individual holding a Director Identification Number (DIN) as on March 31st of a financial year will need to file KYC intimation in Form No. DIR-3 KYC Web once every three consecutive financial years.\n*   **New Due Date:** The filing will be required on or before June 30th of the immediately following every third consecutive financial year.\n*   **For existing directors:** Those who have already completed their KYC till date, their next KYC filing will be due by June 30, 2028.\n*   **Updates:** Any change in a director's mobile number, email address, or residential address must be reported through DIR-3 KYC Web within 30 days, along with the prescribed fees.\n\nThis amendment aims to provide much-needed relief and streamline compliance for directors across companies.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2210552)\n\n*Published on: 5 January 2026*",
