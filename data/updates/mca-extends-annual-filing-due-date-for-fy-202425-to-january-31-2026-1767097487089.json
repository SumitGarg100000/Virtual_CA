  "content": "# MCA Extends Annual Filing Due Date for FY 2024-25 to January 31, 2026!\n\nEk important update hai for all companies and professionals! The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) ne Financial Year 2024-25 ke liye annual filing ki due date extend kar di hai.\n\nThe Government has announced this significant relaxation through General Circular No. 08/2025 dated December 30, 2025, providing much-needed relief to stakeholders.\n\n*   **Financial Year:** FY 2024-25.\n*   **Previous Extended Due Date (as per Circular 06/2025):** December 31, 2025.\n*   **New Due Date:** January 31, 2026.\n*   **Additional Fees:** No additional fees will be levied for filings made till the new extended date.\n*   **Applicable Forms:** This extension covers e-Forms MGT-7, MGT-7A, AOC-4, AOC-4 CFS, AOC-4 NBFC (Ind AS), AOC-4 CFS NBFC (Ind AS), and AOC-4 (XBRL).\n*   **Reason for Extension:** The extension comes after considering various representations from stakeholders and in view of the recent deployment of new e-forms on the MCA-21 Version 3 portal, which required time for familiarization.\n*   **Important Clarification:** Please note, this circular **does not** extend the statutory timelines for holding Annual General Meetings (AGMs). Companies must still adhere to the prescribed AGM deadlines.\n\nThis is a welcome move that provides companies with extra time to ensure compliance without incurring additional penalties. Jaldi se apne filings complete kar lijiye!\n\n## Read the Official Document\n* [Download the Official Notification/Circular here](https://www.mca.gov.in/content/mca/corporate-llp-portal/en/ministry/acts-rules/circulars.html)\n\n*Published on: 30 December 2025*",
