Union Budget 2026-27 announcement dated February 1, 2026, mein Government ne Income Tax Return (ITR) revised return filing ki due date extend karne ka proposal announce kiya hai. This is a big relief for taxpayers!\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget 2026-27, announced this key compliance change.\n\n*   **What's New:** The deadline for filing revised Income Tax Returns has been extended.\n*   **Old Due Date:** Previously, taxpayers could file a revised ITR till December 31st of the assessment year.\n*   **New Due Date:** The revised cut-off date will now be March 31st of the relevant financial year, which effectively extends the window to 12 months from the end of the relevant tax year.\n\n    For instance, for Assessment Year 2025-26 (i.e., Financial Year 2024-25), the new revised return filing due date is now March 31, 2026. This change is applicable from tax year 2025-26 onwards. A nominal fee might be applicable for revisions made after December 31. This measure is aimed at easing compliance and providing more flexibility to taxpayers.\n\n## Read the Official Document\n*   [Download the Official Budget 2026-27 Speech here](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHoqXCJ8pE1nRIZ_5WfzDg-wlQQVRPxF1T6ifnIBoUDI_PQoy5DASdktJlSE6sRDe9awjmUsRxTTP32lyyyrwaL61gj7NKuPsA26ymB-VovM-3AlBJUiOyMCQCmjtXRB5ug9O2mXjh7o2RnxAiHrGtUxvRDKPuRS4FRYpowtwJSGcqtHTEZ3LUxnFfm4MWw9i-KMZrrzBY=)\n\n*Published on: 3 February 2026*",
